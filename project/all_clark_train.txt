i primeval night 1 the road to extinction the drought had lasted now for ten million years and the reign of the terrible lizards had long since ended
here on the equator in the continent which would one day be known as africa the battle for existence had reached a new climax of ferocity and the victor was not yet in sight
in this barren and desiccated land only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish or even hope to survive
the man apes of the veldt were none of these things and they were not flourishing
indeed they were already far down the road to racial extinction
about fifty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small parched valley which was divided by a sluggish stream fed from snows in the mountains two hundred miles to the north
in bad times the stream vanished completely and the tribe lived in the shadow of thirst
it was always hungry and now it was starving
when the first faint glow of dawn crept into the cave moon watcher saw that his father had died in the night
he did not know that the old one was his father for such a relationship was utterly beyond his understanding but as he looked at the emaciated body he felt dim disquiet that was the ancestor of sadness
the two babies were already whimpering for food but became silent when moon watcher snarled at them
one of the mothers defending the infant she could not properly feed gave him an angry growl in return he lacked the energy even to cuff her for her presumption
now it was light enough to leave
moon watcher picked up the shriveled corpse and dragged it after him as he bent under the low overhang of the cave
once outside he threw the body over his shoulder and stood upright the only animal in all this world able to do so
among his kind moon watcher was almost a giant
he was nearly five feet high and though badly undernourished weighed over a hundred pounds
his hairy muscular body was halfway between ape and man but his head was already much nearer to man than ape
the forehead was low and there were ridges over the eye sockets yet he unmistakably held in his genes the promise of humanity
as he looked out upon the hostile world of the pleistocene there was already something in his gaze beyond the capacity of any ape
in those dark deep set eyes was a dawning awareness the first intimations of an intelligence that could not possibly fulfill itself for ages yet and might soon be extinguished forever
there was no sign of danger so moon watcher began to scramble down the almost vertical slope outside the cave only slightly hindered by his burden
as if they had been waiting for his signal the rest of the tribe emerged from their own homes farther down the rock face and began to hasten toward the muddy waters of the stream for their morning drink
moon watcher looked across the valley to see if the others were in sight but there was no trace of them
perhaps they had not yet left their caves or were already foraging farther along the hillside
since they were nowhere to be seen moon watcher forgot them he was incapable of worrying about more than one thing at a time
first he must get rid of the old one but this was a problem that demanded little thought
there had been many deaths this season one of them in his own cave he had only to put the corpse where he had left the new baby at the last quarter of the moon and the hyenas would do the rest
they were already waiting where the little valley fanned out into the savanna almost as if they had known that he was coming
moon watcher left the body under a small bush all the earlier bones were already gone and hurried back to rejoin the tribe
he never thought of his father again
his two mates the adults from the other caves and most of the youngsters were foraging among the drought stunted trees farther up the valley looking for berries succulent roots and leaves and occasional windfalls like small lizards or rodents
only the babies and the feeblest of the old folk were left in the caves if there was any surplus food at the end of the day s searching they might be fed
if not the hyenas would soon be in luck once more
but this day was a good one though as moon watcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one time with another
he had found a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree and so had enjoyed the finest delicacy that his people could ever know he still licked his fingers from time to time as he led the group homeward in the late afternoon
of course he had also collected a fair number of stings but he had scarcely noticed them
he was now as near to contentment as he was ever likely to be for though he was still hungry he was not actually weak with hunger
that was the most to which any man ape could ever aspire
his contentment vanished when he reached the stream
the others were there
they were there every day but that did not make it any the less annoying
there were about thirty of them and they could not have been distinguished from the members of moonwatcher s own tribe
as they saw him coming they begun to dance shake their arms and shriek on their side of the stream and his own people replied in kind
and that was all that happened
though the man apes often fought and wrestled one another their disputes very seldom resulted in serious injuries
having no claws or fighting canine teeth and being well protected by hair they could not inflict much harm on one another
in any event they had little surplus energy for such unproductive behavior snarling and threatening was a much more efficient way of asserting their points of view
the confrontation lasted about five minutes then the display died out as quickly as it had begun and everyone drank his fill of the muddy water
honor had been satisfied each group had staked its claim to its own territory
this important business having been settled the tribe moved off along its side of the river
the nearest worthwhile grazing was now more than a mile from the caves and they had to share it with a herd of large antelope like beasts who barely tolerated their presence
they could not be driven away for they were armed with ferocious daggers on their foreheads the natural weapons which the man apes did not possess
so moon watcher and his companions chewed berries and fruit and leaves and fought off the pangs of hunger while all around them competing for the same fodder was a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat
yet the thousands of tons of succulent meat roaming over the savanna and through the bush was not only beyond their reach it was beyond their imagination
in the midst of plenty they were slowly starving to death
the tribe returned to its cave without incident in the last light of the day
the injured female who had remained behind cooed with pleasure as moon watcher gave her the berry covered branch he had brought back and began to attack it ravenously
there was little enough nourishment here but it would help her to survive until the wound the leopard had given her had healed and she could forage for herself again
over the valley a full moon was rising and a chill wind was blowing down from the distant mountains
it would be very cold tonight but cold like hunger was not a matter for any real concern it was merely part of the background of life
moon watcher barely stirred when the shrieks and screams echoed up the slope from one of the lower caves and he did not need to hear the occasional growl of the leopard to know exactly what was happening
down there in the darkness old white hair and his family were fighting and dying and the thought that he might help in some way never crossed moon watcher s mind
the harsh logic of survival ruled out such fancies and not a voice was raised in protest from the listening hillside
every cave was silent lest it also attract disaster
the tumult died away and presently moon watcher could hear the sound of a body being dragged over rocks
that lasted only a few seconds then the leopard got a good hold on its kill
it made no further noise as it padded silently away carrying its victim effortlessly in its jaws
for a day or two there would be no further danger here but there might be other enemies abroad taking advantage of this cold little sun that shone only by night
if there was sufficient warning the smaller predators could sometimes be scared away by shouts and screams
moon watcher crawled out of the cave clambered onto a large boulder beside the entrance and squatted there to survey the valley
of all the creatures who had yet walked on earth the man apes were the first to look steadfastly at the moon
and though he could not remember it when he was very young moon watcher would sometimes reach out and try to touch that ghostly face rising above the hills
he had never succeeded and now he was old enough to understand why
for first of course he must find a high enough tree to climb
sometimes he watched the valley and sometimes he watched the moon but always he listened
once or twice he dozed off but he slept with a hair trigger alertness and the slightest sound would have disturbed him
at the great age of twenty five he was still in full possession of all his faculties if his luck continued and he avoided accidents disease predators and starvation he might survive for as much as another ten years
the night wore on cold and clear without further alarms and the moon rose slowly amid equatorial constellations that no human eye would ever see
in the caves between spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting were being born the nightmares of generations yet to be
and twice there passed slowly across the sky rising up to the zenith and descending into the east a dazzling point of light more brilliant than any star
2 the new rock late that night moon watcher suddenly awoke
tired out by the day s exertions and disasters he had been sleeping more soundly than usual yet he was instantly alert at the first faint scrabbling down in the valley
he sat up in the fetid darkness of the cave straining his senses out into the night and fear crept slowly into his soul
never in his life already twice as long as most members of his species could expect had he heard a sound like this
the great cats approached in silence and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth or the occasional cracking of a twig
yet this was a continuous crunching noise that grew steadily louder
it seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night making no attempt at concealment and ignoring all obstacles
once moon watcher heard the unmistakable sound of a bush being uprooted the elephants and dinotheria did this often enough but otherwise they moved as silently as the cats
and then there came a sound which moon watcher could not possibly have identified for it had never been heard before in the history of the world
it was the clank of metal upon stone
moon watcher came face to face with the new rock when he led the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning
he had almost forgotten the terrors of the night because nothing had happened after that initial noise so he did not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear
there was after all nothing in the least alarming about it
it was a rectangular slab three times his height but narrow enough to span with his arms and it was made of some completely transparent material indeed it was not easy to see except when the rising sun glinted on its edges
as moon watcher had never encountered ice or even crystal clear water there were no natural objects to which he could compare this apparition
it was certainly rather attractive and though he was wisely cautious of most new things he did not hesitate for long before sidling up to it
as nothing happened he put out his hand and felt a cold hard surface
after several minutes of intense thought he arrived at a brilliant explanation
it was a rock of course and it must have grown during the night
there were many plants that did this white pulpy things shaped like pebbles that seemed to shoot up during the hours of darkness
it was true that they were small and round whereas this was large and sharp edged but greater and later philosophers than moon watcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their theories
this really superb piece of abstract thinking led moon watcher after only three or four minutes to a deduction which he immediately put to the test
the white round pebble plants were very tasty though there were a few that produced violent illness perhaps this tall one
a few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusioned him
there was no nourishment here so like a sensible man ape he continued on his way to the river and forgot all about the crystalline monolith during the daily routine of shrieking at the others
the foraging today was very bad and the tribe had to travel several miles from the caves to find any food at all
during the merciless heat of noon one of the frailer females collapsed far from any possible shelter
her companions gathered round her twittering and meeping sympathetically but there was nothing that anyone could do
if they had been less exhausted they might have carried her with them but there was no surplus energy for such acts of kindness
she had to be left behind to recover or not with her own resources
they passed the spot on the homeward trek that evening there was not a bone to be seen
in the last light of day looking round anxiously for early hunters they drank hastily at the stream and started the climb up to their caves
they were still a hundred yards from the new rock when the sound began
it was barely audible yet it stopped them dead so that they stood paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging slackly
a simple maddeningly repetitious vibration it pulsed out from the crystal and hypnotized all who came within its spell
for the first time and the last for three million years the sound of drumming was heard in africa
the throbbing grew louder more insistent
presently the man apes began to move forward like sleepwalkers toward the source of that compulsive sound
sometimes they took little dancing steps as their blood responded to rhythms that their descendants would not create for ages yet
totally entranced they gathered round the monolith forgetting the hardships of the day the perils of the approaching dusk and the hunger in their bellies
the drumming became louder the night darker
and as the shadows lengthened and the light drained from the sky the crystal began to glow
first it lost its transparency and became suffused with a pale milky luminescence tantalizing ill defined phantoms moved across its surface and in its depths
they coalesced into bars of light and shadow then formed intermeshing spoked patterns that began slowly to rotate
faster and faster spun the wheels of light and the throbbing of the drums accelerated with them
now utterly hypnotized the man apes could only stare slack jawed into this astonishing display of pyrotechnics
they had already forgotten the instincts of their forefathers and the lessons of a lifetime not one of them ordinarily would have been so far from his cave so late in the evening
for the surrounding brush was full of frozen shapes and staring eyes as the creatures of the night suspended their business to see what would happen next
now the spinning wheels of light began to merge and the spokes fused into luminous bars that slowly receded into the distance rotating on their axes as they did so
they split into pairs and the resulting sets of lines started to oscillate across one another slowly changing their angles of intersection
fantastic fleeting geometrical patterns flickered in and out of existence as the glowing grids meshed and unmeshed and the man apes watched mesmerized captives of the shining crystal
they could never guess that their minds were being probed their bodies mapped their reactions studied their potentials evaluated
at first the whole tribe remained half crouching in a motionless tableau as if frozen into stone
then the man ape nearest to the slab suddenly came to life
he did not move from his position but his body lost its trancelike rigidity and became animated as if it were a puppet controlled by invisible strings
the head turned this way and that the mouth silently opened and closed the hands clenched and unclenched
then he bent down snapped off a long stalk of grass and attempted to tie it into a knot with clumsy fingers
he seemed to be a thing possessed struggling against some spirit or demon who had taken over control of his body
he was panting for breath and his eyes were full of terror as he tried to force his fingers to make movements more complex than any that they had ever attempted before
despite all his efforts he succeeded only in breaking the stalk into pieces
as the fragments fell to the ground the controlling influence left him and he froze once more into immobility
another man ape came to life and went through the same routine
this was a younger more adaptable specimen it succeeded where the older one had failed
on the planet earth the first crude knot had been tied
others did stranger and still more pointless things
some held their hands out at arm s length and tried to touch their fingertips together first with both eyes open then with one closed
some were made to stare at ruled patterns in the crystal which became more and more finely divided until the lines had merged into a gray blur
and all heard single pure sounds of varying pitch that swiftly sank below the level of hearing
when moon watcher s turn came he felt very little fear
his main sensation was a dull resentment as his muscles twitched and his limbs moved at commands that were not wholly his own
without knowing why he bent down and picked up a small stone
when he straightened up he saw that there was a new image in the crystal slab
the grids and the moving dancing patterns had gone
instead there was a series of concentric circles surrounding a small black disk
obeying the silent orders in his brain he pitched the stone with a clumsy overarm throw
it missed the target by several feet
try again said the command
he searched around until he had found another pebble
this time it hit the slab with a ringing bell like tone
he was still a long way off but his aim was improving
at the fourth attempt he was only inches from the central bull s eye
a feeling of indescribable pleasure almost sexual in its intensity flooded his mind
then the control relaxed he felt no impulse to do anything except to stand and wait
one by one every member of the tribe was briefly possessed
some succeeded but most failed at the tasks they had been set and all were appropriately rewarded by spasms of pleasure or of pain
now there was only a uniform featureless glow in the great slab so that it stood like a block of light superimposed oil the surrounding darkness
as if waking from a sleep the man apes shook their heads and presently began to move along the trail to their place of shelter
they did not look back or wonder at the strange light that was guiding them to their homes and to a future unknown as yet even to the stars
3 academy moon watcher and his companions had no recollection of what they had seen after the crystal had ceased to cast its hypnotic spell over their minds and to experiment with their bodies
the next day as they went out to forage they passed it with scarcely a second thought it was now part of the disregarded background of their lives
they could not eat it and it could not eat them therefore it was not important
down at the river the others made their usual ineffectual threats
their leader a one eared man ape of moon watcher s size and age but in poorer condition even made a brief foray toward the tribe s territory screaming loudly and waving his arms in an attempt to scare the opposition and to bolster his own courage
the water of the stream was nowhere more than a foot deep but the farther one ear moved out into it the more uncertain and unhappy he became
very soon he slowed to a halt and then moved back with exaggerated dignity to join his companions
otherwise there was no change in the normal routine
the tribe gathered just enough nourishment to survive for another day and no one died
and that night the crystal slab was still waiting surrounded by its pulsing aura of light and sound
the program it had contrived however was now subtly different
some of the man apes it ignored completely as if it was concentrating on the most promising subjects
one of them was moon watcher once again he felt inquisitive tendrils creeping down the unused byways of his brain
and presently he began to see visions
they might have been within the crystal block they might have been wholly inside his mind
in any event to moon watcher they were completely real
yet somehow the usual automatic impulse to drive off invaders of his territory had been lulled into quiescence
he was looking at a peaceful family group differing in only one respect from the scenes he knew
the male female and two infants that had mysteriously appeared before him were gorged and replete with sleek and glossy pelts and this was a condition of life that moon watcher had never imagined
unconsciously he felt his own protruding ribs the ribs of these creatures were hidden in rolls of fat
from time to time they stirred lazily as they lolled at ease near the entrance of a cave apparently at peace with the world
occasionally the big male emitted a monumental burp of contentment
there was no other activity and after five minutes the scene suddenly faded out
the crystal was no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness moon watcher shook himself as if awaking from a dream abruptly realized where he was and led the tribe back to the caves
he had no conscious memory of what he had seen but that night as he sat brooding at the entrance of his lair his ears attuned to the noises of the world around him moon watcher felt the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion
it was a vague and diffuse sense of envy of dissatisfaction with his life
he had no idea of its cause still less of its cure but discontent had come into his soul and he had taken one small step toward humanity
night after night the spectacle of those four plump man apes was repeated until it had become a source of fascinated exasperation serving to increase moon watcher s eternal gnawing hunger
the evidence of his eyes could not have produced this effect it needed psychological reinforcement
there were gaps in moon watcher s life now that he would never remember when the very atoms of his simple brain were being twisted into new patterns
if he survived those patterns would become eternal for his genes would pass them on to future generations
it was a slow tedious business but the crystal monolith was patient
neither it nor its replicas scattered across half the globe expected to succeed with all the scores of groups involved in the experiment
a hundred failures would not matter when a single success could change the destiny of the world
by the time of the next new moon the tribe had seen one birth and two deaths
one of these had been due to starvation the other had occurred during the nightly ritual when a man ape had suddenly collapsed while attempting to tap two pieces of stone delicately together
at once the crystal had darkened and the tribe had been released from the spell
but the fallen man ape had not moved and by the morning of course the body was gone
there had been no performance the next night the crystal was still analyzing its mistake
the tribe streamed past it through the gathering dusk ignoring its presence completely
the night after it was ready for them again
the four plump man apes were still there and now they were doing extraordinary things
moon watcher began to tremble uncontrollably he felt as if his brain would burst and wanted to turn away his eyes
but that remorseless mental control would not relax its grip he was compelled to follow the lesson to the end though all his instincts revolted against it
those instincts had served his ancestors well in the days of warm rains and lush fertility when food was to be had everywhere for the plucking
now times had changed and the inherited wisdom of the past had become folly
the man apes must adapt or they must die like the greater beasts who had gone before them and whose bones now lay sealed within the limestone hills
so moon watcher stared at the crystal monolith with unblinking eyes while his brain lay open to its still uncertain manipulations
often he felt nausea but always he felt hunger and from time to time his hands clenched unconsciously in the patterns that would determine his new way of life
as the line of warthogs moved snuffling and grunting across the trail moon watcher came to a sudden halt
pigs and man apes had always ignored each other for there was no conflict of interest between them
like most animals that did not compete for the same food they merely kept out of each other s way
yet now moon watcher stood looking at them wavering back and forth uncertainly as he was buffeted by impulses which he could not understand then as if in a dream he started searching the ground though for what he could not have explained even if he had had the power of speech
he would recognize it when he saw it
it was a heavy pointed stone about six inches long and though it did not fit his hand perfectly it would do
as he swung his hand around puzzled by its suddenly increased weight he felt a pleasing sense of power and authority
he started to move toward the nearest pig
it was a young and foolish animal even by the undemanding standards of warthog intelligence
though it observed him out of the corner of its eye it did not take him seriously until much too late
why should it suspect these harmless creatures of any evil intent
it went on rooting up the grass until moon watcher s stone hammer obliterated its dim consciousness
the remainder of the herd continued grazing unalarmed for the murder had been swift and silent
all the other man apes in the group had stopped to watch and now they crowded round moon watcher and his victim with admiring wonder
presently one of them picked up the blood stained weapon and began to pound the dead pig
others joined in with any sticks and stones that they could gather until theirt target began a messy disintegration
then they became bored some wandered off while others stood hesitantly around the unrecognizable corpse the future of a world waiting upon their decision
it was a surprisingly long time before one of the nursing females began to lick the gory stone she was holding in her paws
and it was longer still before moon watcher despite all that he had been shown really understood that he need never be hungry again
4 the leopard the tools they had been programmed to use were simple enough yet they could change this world and make the man apes its masters
the most primitive was the hand held stone that multiplied manyfold the power of a blow
then there was the bone club that lengthened the reach and could provide a buffer against the fangs or claws of angry animals
with these weapons the limitless food that roamed the savannas was theirs to take
but they needed other aids for their teeth and nails could not readily dismember anything larger than a rabbit luckily nature had provided the perfect tools requiring only the wit to pick them up first there was a crude but very efficient knife or saw of a model that would serve well for the next three million years
it was simply the lower jawbone of an antelope with the teeth still in place there would be no substantial improvement until the coming of steel
then there was an awl or dagger in the form of a gazelle horn and finally a scraping tool made from the complete jaw of almost any small animal
the stone club the toothed saw the horn dagger the bone scraper these were the marvelous inventions which the man apes needed in order to survive
soon they would recognize them for the symbols of power that they were but many months must pass before their clumsy fingers had acquired the skill or the will to use them
perhaps given time they might by their own efforts have come to the awesome and brilliant concept of using natural weapons as artificial tools
but the odds were all against them and even now there were endless opportunities for failure in the ages that lay ahead
the man apes had been given their first chance
there would be no second one the future was very literally in their own hands
moons waxed and waned babies were born and sometimes lived feeble toothless thirty year olds died the leopard took its toll in the night the others threatened daily across the river and the tribe prospered
in the course of a single year moon watcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition
they had learned their lessons well now they could handle all the tools that had been revealed to them
the very memory of hunger was fading from their minds and though the warthogs were becoming shy there were gazelles and antelopes and zebras in countless thousands on the plains
all these animals and others had fallen prey to the apprentice hunters
now that they were no longer half numbed with starvation they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought
their new way of life was now casually accepted and they did not associate it in any way with the monolith still standing beside the trail to the river
if they had ever stopped to consider the matter they might have boasted that they had brought about their improved status by their own efforts in fact they had already forgotten any other mode of existence
but no utopia is perfect and this one had two blemishes
the first was the marauding leopard whose passion for man apes seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished
the second was the tribe across the river for somehow the others had survived and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation
the leopard problem was resolved partly by chance partly owing to a serious indeed almost fatal error on moon watcher s part
yet at the time his idea had seemed such a brilliant one that he had danced with joy and perhaps he could hardly be blamed for overlooking the consequences
the tribe still experienced occasional bad days though these no longer threatened its very survival
toward dusk it had failed to make a kill the home caves were already in sight as moon watcher led his tired and disgruntled companions back to shelter
and there on their very threshold they found one of nature s rare bonanzas
a full grown antelope was lying by the trail
its foreleg was broken but it still had plenty of fight in it and the circling jackals gave its daggerlike horns a respectful berth
they could afford to wait they knew that they had only to bide their time
but they had forgotten about the competition and retreated with angry snarls when the man apes arrived
they too circled warily keeping beyond the range of those dangerous horns then they moved to the attack with clubs and stones
it was not a very effective or coordinated attack by the time the wretched beast had been given its quietus the light had almost gone and the jackals were regaining their courage
moon watcher torn between fear and hunger slowly realized that all this effort might have been in vain
it was too dangerous to stay here any longer
then not for the first or the last time he proved himself a genius
with an immense effort of imagination he visualized the dead antelope in the safety of his own cave
he began to drag it toward the cliff face presently the others understood his intentions and began to help him
if he had known how difficult the task would be he would never have attempted it
only his great strength and the agility inherited from his arboreal ancestors allowed him to haul the carcass up the steep slope
several times weeping with frustration he almost abandoned his prize but a stubbornness as deep seated as his hunger drove him on
sometimes the others helped him sometimes they hindered more often they merely got in the way
but finally it was done the battered antelope was dragged over the lip of the cave as the last hues of sunlight faded from the sky and the feasting began
hours later gorged to repletion moon watcher awoke
not knowing why he sat up in the darkness among the sprawled bodies of his equally satiated companions and strained his ears into the night
there was no sound except the heavy breathing around him the whole world seemed asleep
the rocks beyond the mouth of the cave were pale as bone in the brilliant light from the moon now high overhead
any thought of danger seemed infinitely remote
then from a long way off came the sound of a falling pebble
fearful yet inquisitive moon watcher crawled out onto the ledge of the cave and peered down the face of the cliff
what he saw left him so paralyzed with fright that for long seconds he was unable to move
only twenty feet below two gleaming golden eyes were staring straight up at him they held him so hypnotized with fear that he was scarcely aware of the lithe streaked body behind them flowing smoothly and silently from rock to rock
never before had the leopard climbed so high
it had ignored the lower caves though it must have been well aware of their inhabitants
now it was after other game it was following the spoor of blood up the moon washed face of the cliff
seconds later the night was made hideous by the shrieks of alarm from the man apes in the cave above
the leopard gave a snarl of fury as it realized that it had lost the element of surprise
but it did not check its advance for it knew that it had nothing to fear
it reached the ledge and rested for a moment on the narrow open space
the scent of blood was all around filling its fierce and tiny mind with one overwhelming desire
without hesitation it padded silently into the cave
and here it made its first error for as it moved out of the moonlight even its superbly night adapted eyes were at a momentary disadvantage
the man apes could see it partly silhouetted against the opening of the cave more clearly than it could see them
they were terrified but they were no longer utterly helpless
snarling and lashing its tail in arrogant confidence the leopard advanced in search of the tender food that it craved
had it met its prey in the open it would have had no problems but now that the man apes were trapped desperation had given them the courage to attempt the impossible
and for the first time they had the means to achieve it
the leopard knew that something was wrong when it felt a stunning blow on its head
it lashed out with its forepaw and heard a shriek of agony as its claws slashed through soft flesh
then there was a piercing pain as something sharp drove into its flanks once twice and yet a third time
it whirled around to strike at the shadows screaming and dancing on all sides
again there was a violent blow as something caught it across the snout
its teeth snapped on a white moving blur only to grate uselesssly upon dead bone
and now in a final unbelievable indignity its tail was being dragged out by the roots
it whirled around throwing its insanely daring tormentor against the wall of the cave
yet whatever it did it could not escape the rain of blows inflicted on it by crude weapons wielded by clumsy but powerful hands
its snarls ran the gamut from pain to alarm from alarm to outright terror
the implacable hunter was now the victim and was desperately trying to retreat
and then it made its second mistake for in its surprise and fright it had forgotten where it was
or perhaps it had been dazed or blinded by the blows rained on its head whatever the case it bolted abruptly from the cave
there was a horrible screech as it went toppling out into space
ages later it seemed there came a thud as it crashed into an outcropping halfway down the cliff thereafter the only sound was the sliding of loose stones which quickly died away into the night
for a long time intoxicated by victory moon watcher stood dancing and gibbering at the entrance of the cave
he rightly sensed that his whole world had changed and that he was no longer a powerless victim of the forces around him
then he went back into the cave and for the first time in his life had an unbroken night s sleep
in the morning they i found the body of the leopard at the foot of the cliff
even in death it was some time before anyone dared to approach the vanquished monster but presently they closed in upon it with their bone knives and saws
it was very hard work and they did no hunting that day
5 encounter in the dawn as he led the tribe down to the river in the dim light of dawn moon watcher paused uncertainly at a familiar spot
something he knew was missing but what it was he could not remember
he wasted no mental effort on the problem for this morning he had more important matters on his mind
like thunder and lightning and clouds and eclipses the great block of crystal had departed as mysteriously as it had come
having vanished into the nonexistent past it never troubled moon watcher s thoughts again
he would never know what it had done to him and none of his companions wondered as they gathered round him in the morning mist why he had paused for a moment here on the way to the river
from their side of the stream in the never violated safety of their own territory the others first saw moon watcher and a dozen males of his tribe as a moving frieze against the dawn sky
at once they began to scream their daily challenge but this time there was no answer
steadily purposefully above all silently moon watcher and his band descended the low hillock that overlooked the river and as they approached the others became suddenly quiet
their ritual rage ebbed away to be replaced by a mounting fear
they were dimly aware that something had happened and that this encounter was unlike all those that had ever gone before
the bone clubs and knives that moon watcher s group carried did not alarm them for they did not understand their purpose
they only knew that their rivals movements were now imbued with determination and with menace
the party stopped at the water s edge and for a moment the others courage revived
led by one ear they halfheartedly resumed their battle chant
it lasted only a few seconds before a vision of terror struck then dumb
moon watcher raised his arms high into the air revealing the burden that until now had been concealed by the hirsute bodies of his companions
he was holding a stout branch and impaled upon it was the bloody head of the leopard
the mouth had been jammed open with a stick and the great fangs gleamed a ghastly white in the first rays of the rising sun
most of the others were too paralyzed with fright to move but some began a slow stumbling retreat
that was all the encouragement that moon watcher needed
still holding the mangled trophy above his head he started to cross the stream
after a moment s hesitation his companions splashed after him
when moon watcher reached the far side one ear was still standing his ground
perhaps he was too brave or too stupid to run perhaps he could not really believe that this outrage was actually happening
coward or hero it made no difference in the end as the frozen snarl of death came crashing down upon his uncomprehending head
shrieking with fright the others scattered into the bush but presently they would return and soon they would forget their lost leader
for a few seconds moon watcher stood uncertainly above his new victim trying to grasp the strange and wonderful fact that the dead leopard could kill again
now he was master of the world and he was not quite sure what to do next
but he would thinkof something
6 ascent of man a new animal was abroad on the planet spreading slowly out from the african heartland
it was still so rare that a hasty census might have overlooked it among the teeming billions of creatures roving over land and sea
there was no evidence as yet that it would prosper or even survive on this world where so many mightier beasts had passed away its fate still wavered in the balance
in the hundred thousand years since the crystals had descended upon africa the man apes had invented nothing
but they had started to change and had developed skills which no other animal possessed
their bone clubs had increased their reach and multiplied their strength they were no longer defenseless against the predators with whom they had to compete
the smaller carnivores they could drive away from their own kills the larger ones they could at least discourage and sometimes put to flight
their massive teeth were growing smaller for they were no longer essential
the sharp edged stones that could be used to dig out roots or to cut and saw through tough flesh or fiber had begun to replace them with immeasurable consequences
no longer were the man apes faced with starvation when their teeth became damaged or worn even the crudest tools could add many years to their lives
and as their fangs diminished the shape of their face started to alter the snout receded the massive jaw became more delicate the mouth able to make more subtle sounds
speech was still a million years away but the first steps toward it had been taken
and then the world began to change
in four great waves with two hundred thousand years between their crests the ice ages swept by leaving their mark on all the globe
outside the tropics the glaciers slew those who had prematurely left theft ancestral home and everywhere they winnowed out the creatures who could not adapt
when the ice had passed so had much of the planet s early life including the man apes
but unlike so many others they had left descendants they had not merely become extinct they had been transformed
the toolmakers had been remade by their own tools
for in using clubs and flints their hands had developed a dexterity found nowhere else in the animal kingdom permitting them to make still better tools which in turn had developed their limbs and brains yet further
it was an accelerating cumulative process and at its end was man
the first true men had tools and weapons only a little better than those of their ancestors a million years earlier but they could use them with far greater skill
and somewhere in the shadowy centuries that had gone before they had invented the most essential tool of all though it could be neither seen nor touched
they had learned to speak and so had won their first great victory over time
now the knowledge of one generation could be handed on to the next so that each age could profit from those that had gone before
unlike the animals who knew only the present man had acquired a past and he was beginning to grope toward a future
he was also learning to harness the forces of nature with the taming of fire he had laid the foundations of technology and left his animal origins far behind
stone gave way to bronze and then to iron
hunting was succeeded by agriculture
the tribe grew into the village the village into the town
speech became eternal thanks to certain marks on stone and clay and papyrus
presently he invented philosophy and religion
and he peopled the sky not altogether inaccurately with gods
as his body became more and more defenseless so his means of offense became steadily more frightful
with stone and bronze and iron and steel he had run the gamut of everything that could pierce and slash and quite early in time he had learned how to strike down his victims from a distance
the spear the bow the gun and finally the guided missile had given him weapons of infinite range and all but infinite power
without those weapons often though he had used them against himself man would never have conquered his world
into them he had put his heart and soul and for ages they had served him well
but now as long as they existed he was living on borrowed time
ii tma 1 7 special flight no matter how many times you left earth dr heywood floyd told himself the excitement never really palled
he had been to mars once to the moon three times and to the various space stations more often than he could remember
yet as the moment of takeoff approached he was conscious of a rising tension a feeling of wonder and awe yes and of nervousness which put him on the same level as any earthlubber about to receive his first baptism of space
the jet that had rushed him here from washington after that midnight briefing with the president was now dropping down toward one of the most familiar yet most exciting landscapes in all the world
there lay the first two generations of the space age spanning twenty miles of the florida coast to the south outlined by winking red warning lights were the giant gantries of the saturns and neptunes that had set men on the path to the planets and had now passed into history
near the horizon a gleaming silver tower bathed in floodlights stood the last of the saturn v s for almost twenty years a national monument and place of pilgrimage
not far away looming against the sky like a man made mountain was the incredible bulk of the vehicle assembly building still the largest single structure on earth
but these things now belonged to the past and he was flying toward the future
as they banked dr floyd could see below him a maze of buildings then a great airstrip then a broad dead straight scar across the fiat florida landscape the multiple rails of a giant launch lug track
at its end surrounded by vehicles and gantries a spaceplane lay gleaming in a pool of light being prepared for its leap to the stars
in a sudden failure of perspective brought on by his swift changes of speed and height it seemed to floyd that he was looking down on a small silver moth caught in the beam of a flashlight
then the tiny scurrying figures on the ground brought home to him the real size of the spacecraft it must have been two hundred feet across the narrow v of its wings
and that enormous vehicle floyd told himself with some incredulity yet also with some pride is waiting for me
as far as he knew it was the first time that an entire mission had been set up to take a single man to the moon
though it was two o clock in the morning a group of reporters and cameramen intercepted him on his way to the floodlit orion iii spacecraft
he knew several of them by sight for as chairman of the national council of astronautics the news conference was part of his way of life
this was neither the time nor the place for one and he had nothing to say but it was important not to offend the gentlemen of the communications media
dr
floyd
i m jim forster of associated news
could you give us a few words about this flight of yours i m very sorry i can t say anything but you did meet with the president earlier this evening asked a familiar voice
oh hello mike
i m afraid you ve been dragged out of bed for nothing
definitely no comment can you at least confirm or deny that some kind of epidemic has broken out on the moon a tv reporter asked managing to jog alongside and keep floyd properly framed in his miniature tv camera
sorry said floyd shaking his head
what about the quarantine asked another reporter
how long will it be kept on still no comment dr
floyd demanded a very short and determined lady of the press what possible justification can there be for this total blackout of news from the moon
has it anything to do with the political situation what political situation floyd asked dryly
there was a sprinkle of laughter and someone called have a good trip doctor as he made his way into the sanctuary of the boarding gantry
as long as he could remember it had been not a situation so much as a permanent crisis
since the 197 s the world had been dominated by two problems which ironically tended to cancel each other out
though birth control was cheap reliable and endorsed by all the main religions it had come too late the population of the world was now six billion a third of them in the chinese empire
laws had even been passed in some authoritarian societies limiting families to two children but their enforcement had proved impracticable
as a result food was short in every country even the united states had meatless days and widespread famine was predicted within fifteen years despite heroic efforts to farm the sea and to develop synthetic foods
with the need for international cooperation more urgent than ever there were still as many frontiers as in any earlier age
in a million years the human race had lost few of its aggressive instincts along symbolic lines visible only to politicians the thirty eight nuclear powers watched one another with belligerent anxiety
among them they possessed sufficient megatonnage to remove the entire surface crust of the planet
although there had been miraculously no use of atomic weapons this situation could hardly last forever
and now for their own inscrutable reasons the chinese were offering to the smallest have not nations a complete nuclear capability of fifty warheads and delivery systems
the cost was under 2 and easy terms could be arranged
perhaps they were only trying to shore up their sagging economy by turning obsolete weapons systems into hard cash as some observers had suggested
or perhaps they had discovered methods of warfare so advanced that they no longer had need of such toys there had been talk of radio hypnosis from satellite transmitters compulsion viruses and blackmail by synthetic diseases for which they alone possessed the antidote
these charming ideas were almost certainly propaganda or pure fantasy but it was not safe to discount any of them
every time floyd took off from earth he wondered if it would still be there when the time came to return
the trim stewardess greeted him as he entered the cabin
good morning dr floyd
i m miss simmons i d like to welcome you aboard on behalf of captain tynes and our copilot first officer ballard thank you said floyd with a smile wondering why stewardesses always had to sound like robot tour guides
takeoff s in five minutes she said gesturing into the empty twenty passenger cabin
you can take any seat you want but captain tynes recommends the forward window seat on the left if you want to watch the docking operations i ll do that he answered moving toward the preferred seat
the stewardess fussed over him awhile and then moved to her cubicle at the rear of the cabin
floyd settled down in his seat adjusted the safety harness around waist and shoulders and strapped his briefcase to the adjacent seat
a moment later the loudspeaker came on with a soft popping noise
good morning said miss simmons voice
this is special flight 3 kennedy to space station one she was determined it seemed to go through the full routine for her solitary passenger and floyd could not resist a smile as she continued inexorably
our transit time will be fifty five minutes
maximum acceleration will be two gee and we will be weightless for thirty minutes
please do not leave your seat until the safety sign is lit floyd looked over his shoulder and called thank you he caught a glimpse of a slightly embarrassed but charming smile
he leaned back into his seat and relaxed
this trip he calculated would cost the taxpayers slightly over a million dollars
if it was not justified he would be out of his job but he could always go back to the university and to his interrupted studies of planetary formation
auto countdown procedures all go the captain s voice said over the speaker with the soothing singsong used in rt chat
lift off in one minute as always it seemed more like an hour
floyd became acutely aware of the gigantic forces coiled up around him waiting to be released
in the fuel tanks of the two spacecraft and in the power storage system of the launching track was pent up the energy of a nuclear bomb
and it would all be used to take him a mere two hundred miles from earth
there was none of the old fashioned five foijr three two one zero business so tough on the human nervous system
launching in fifteen seconds
you will be more comfortable if you start breathing deeply that was good psychology and good physiology
floyd felt himself well charged with oxygen and ready to tackle anything when the launching track began to sling its thousand ton payload out over the atlantic
it was hard to tell when they lifted from the track and became airborne but when the roar of the rockets suddenly doubled its fury and floyd found himself sinking deeper and deeper into the cushions of his seat he knew that the first stage engines had taken over
he wished he could look out of the window but it was an effort even to turn his head yet there was no discomfort indeed the pressure of acceleration and the overwhelming thunder of the motors produced an extraordinary euphoria
his ears ringing the blood pounding in his veins floyd felt more alive than he had for years
he was young again he wanted to sing aloud which was certainly safe for no one could possibly hear him
the mood passed swiftly as he suddenly realized that he was leaving earth and everything he had ever loved
down there were his three children motherless since his wife had taken that fatal flight to europe ten years ago
ten years
impossible
yet it was so perhaps for their sake he should have remarried
he had almost lost sense of time when the pressure and the noise abruptly slackened and the cabin speaker announced preparing to separate from lower stage
here we go there was a slight jolt and suddenly floyd recalled a quotation of leonardo da vinci s which he had once seen displayed in a nasa office the great bird will take its flight on the back of the great bird bringing glory to the nest where it was born
well the great bird was flying now beyond all the dreams of da vinci and its exhausted companion was winging back to earth
in a ten thousand mile arc the empty lower stage would glide down into the atmosphere trading speed for distance as it homed on kennedy
in a few hours serviced and refueled it would be ready again to lift another companion toward the shining silence with it could never reach
now thought floyd we are on our own more than halfway to orbit
when the acceleration came on again as the upper stage rockets fired the thrust was much more gentle indeed he felt no more than normal gravity
but it would have been impossible to walk since up was straight toward the front of the cabin
if he had been foolish enough to leave his seat he would have crashed at once against the rear wall
this effect was a little disconcerting for it seemed that the ship was standing on its tail
to floyd who was at the very front of the cabin all the seats appeared to be fixed on a wall topping vertically beneath him
he was doing his best to ignore this uncomfortable illusion when dawn exploded outside the ship
in seconds they shot through veils of crimson and pink and gold and blue into the piercing white of day
though the windows were heavily tinted to reduce the glare the probing beams of sunlight that now slowly swept across the cabin left floyd half blinded for several minutes
he was in space yet there was no question of being able to see the stars
he shielded his eyes with his hands and tried to peer through the window beside him
out there the swept back wing of the ship was blazing like white hot metal in the reflected sunlight there was utter darkness all around it and that darkness must be full of stars but it was impossible to see them
weight was slowly ebbing the rockets were being throttled back as the ship eased itself into orbit
the thunder of the engines dropped to a muted roar then a gentle hiss then died into silence
if it had not been for the restraining straps floyd would have floated out of his seat his stomach felt as if it was going to do so anyway
he hoped that the pills he had been given half an hour and ten thousand miles ago would perform as per specifications
he had been spacesick just once in his career and that was much too often
the pilot s voice was firm and confident as it came over the cabin speaker
please observe all zero gee regulations
we will be docking at space station one in forty five minutes the stewardess came walking up the narrow corridor to the right of the closely spaced seats
there was a slight buoyancy about her steps and her feet came away from the floor reluctantly as if entangled in glue
she was keeping to the bright yellow band of velcro carpeting that ran the full length of the floor and of the ceiling
the carpet and the soles of her sandals were covered with myriads of tiny hooks so that they clung together like burrs
this trick of walking in free fall was immensely reassuring to disoriented passengers
would you like some coffee or tea dr floyd she asked cheerfully
no thank you he smiled
he always felt like a baby when he had to suck at one of those plastic drinking tubes
the stewardess was still hovering anxiously around him as he popped open his briefcase and prepared to remove his papers
dr
floyd may i ask you a question certainly he answered looking up over his glasses
my fianc is a geologist at clavius said miss simmons measuring her words carefully and i haven t heard from him for over a week i m sorry to hear that maybe he s away from his base and out of touch she shook her head
he always tells me when that s going to happen
and you can imagine how worried i am with all these rumors
is it really true about an epidemic on the moon if it is there s no cause for alarm
remember there was a quarantine back in 98 over that mutated flu virus
a lot of people were sick but no one died and that s really all i can say he concluded firmly
miss simmons smiled pleasantly and straightened up
well thank you anyway doctor
i m sorry to have bothered you no bother at all he said gallantly but not very accurately
then he buried himself in his endless technical reports in a desperate last minute assault on the usual backlog he would have no time for reading when he got to the moon
8 orbital rendezvous half an hour later the pilot announced we make contact in ten minutes
please check your seat harness floyd obeyed and put away his papers
it was asking for trouble to read during the celestial juggling act which took place during the last 3 miles best to close one s eyes and relax while the spacecraft was nudged back and forth with brief bursts of rocket power
a few minutes later he caught his first glimpse of space station one only a few miles away
the sunlight glinted and sparkled from the polished metal surfaces of the slowly revolving three hundred yard diameter disk
not far away drifting in the same orbit was a sweptback titov v spaceplane and close to that an almost spherical aries 1b the workhorse of space with the four stubby legs of its lunar landing shock absorbers jutting from one side
the orion iii spacecraft was descending from a higher orbit which brought the earth into spectacular view behind the station
from his altitude of 2 miles floyd could see much of africa and the atlantic ocean
there was considerable cloud cover but he could still detect the blue green outlines of the gold coast
the central axis of the space station with its docking arms extended was now slowly swimming toward them
unlike the structure from which it sprang it was not rotating or rather it was running in reverse at a rate which exactly countered the station s own spin
thus a visiting spacecraft could be coupled to it for the transfer of personnel or cargo without being whirled disastrously around
with the softest of thuds ship and station made contact
there were metallic scratching noises from outside then the brief hissing of air as pressures equalized
a few seconds later the airlock door opened and a man wearing the light close fitting slacks and short sleeved shirt which was almost the uniform of space station personnel came into the cabin
pleased to meet you dr floyd
i m nick miller station security i m to look after you until the shuttle leaves they shook hands then floyd smiled at the stewardess and said please give my compliments to captain tynes and thank him for the smooth ride
perhaps i ll see you on the way home very cautiously it was more than a year since he had last been weightless and it would be some time before he regained his spacelegs he hauled himself hand over hand through the airlock and into the large circular chamber at the axis of the space station
it was a heavily padded room its walls covered with recessed handholds floyd gripped one of these firmly while the whole chamber started to rotate until it matched the spin of the station
as it gained speed faint and ghostly gravitational fingers began to clutch at him and he drifted slowly toward the circular wall
now he was standing swaying back and forth gently like seaweed in the surge of the tide on what had magically become a curving floor
the centrifugal force of the station s spin had taken hold of him it was very feeble here so near the axis but would increase steadily as he moved outward
from the central transit chamber he followed miller down a curving stair
at first his weight was so slight that he had almost to force himself downward by holding on to the handrail
not until he reached the passenger lounge on the outer skin of the great revolving disk had he acquired enough weight to move around almost normally
the lounge had been redecorated since his last visit and had acquired several new facilities
besides the usual chairs small tables restaurant and post office there were now a barber shop drugstore movie theater and a souvenir shop selling photographs and slides of lunar and planetary landscapes guaranteed genuine pieces of luniks rangers and surveyors all neatly mounted in plastic and exorbitantly priced
can i get you anything while we re waiting miller asked
we board in about thirty minutes
i could do with a cup of black coffee two lumps and i d like to call earth right doctor i ll get the coffee the phones are over there the picturesque booths were only a few yards from a barrier with two entrances labeled welcome to the u s
section and welcome to the soviet section
beneath these were notices which read in english russian and chinese french german and spanish
please have ready your passport visa medical certificate transportation permit weight declaration there was a rather pleasant symbolism about the fact that as soon as they had passed through the barriers in either direction passengers were free to mix again
the division was purely for administrative purposes
floyd after checking that the area code for the united states was still 81 punched his twelve digit home number dropped his plastic all purpose credit card into the pay slot and was through in thirty seconds
washington was still sleeping for it was several hours to dawn but he would not disturb anyone
his housekeeper would get the message from the recorder as soon as she awoke
miss flemming this is dr floyd
sorry i had to leave in such a hurry
would you please call my office and ask them to collect the car it s at dulles airport and the key is with mr bailey senior flight control officer
next will you call the chevy chase country club and leave a message for the secretary
i definitely won t be able to play in the tennis tournament next weekend
give my apologies i m afraid they were counting on me
then call downtown electronies and tell them that if the video in my study isn t fixed by oh wednesday they can take the damn thing back he paused for breath and tried to think of any other crises or problems that might arise during the days ahead
if you run short of cash speak to the office they can get urgent messages to me but i may be too busy to answer
give my love to the children and say i ll be back as soon as i can
oh hell here s someone i don t want to see i ll call from the moon if i can good bye floyd tried to duck out of the booth but it was too late he had already been spotted
bearing down on him through the soviet section exit was dr dimitri moisevitch of the u s s r academy of science
dimitri was one of floyd s best friends and for that very reason he was the last person he wished to talk to here and now
9 moon shuttle the russian astronomer was tall slender and blond and his unlined face belied his fifty five years the last ten of which had been spent building up the giant radio observatory on the far side of the moon where two thousand miles of solid rock would shield it from the eletronic racket of earth
why heywood he said shaking hands firmly
it s a small universe how are you and your charming children we re fine floyd replied warmly but with a slightly distracted air
we often talk about the wonderful time you gave us last summer he was sorry he could not sound more sincere they really had enjoyed a week s vacation in odessa with dimitri during one of the russian s visits to earth
and you i suppose you re on your way up dimitri inquired
er yes my flight leaves in half an hour answered floyd
do you know mr miller the security officer had now approached and was standing at a respectful distance holding a plastic cup full of coffee
of course
but please put that down mr miller
this is dr floyd s last chance to have a civilized drink let s not waste it
no i insist they followed dimitri out of the main lounge into the observation section and soon were sitting at a table under a dim light watching the moving panorama of the stars
space station one revolved once a minute and the centrifugal force generated by this slow spin produced an artificial gravity equal to the moon s
this it had been discovered was a good compromise between earth gravity and no gravity at all moreover it gave moon bound passengers a chance to become acclimatized
outside the almost invisible windows earth and stars marched in a silent procession
at the moment this side of the station was tilted away from the sun otherwise it would have been impossible to look out for the lounge would have been blasted with light
even as it was the glare of the earth filling half the sky drowned all but the brighter stars
but earth was waning as the station orbited toward the night side of the planet in a few minutes it would be a huge black disk spangled with the lights of cities
and then the sky would belong to the stars
now said dimitri after he had swiftly downed his first drink and was toying with the second what s all this about an epidemic in the u s sector
i wanted to go there on this trip
no professor they told me
we re very sorry but there s a strict quarantine until further notice
i pulled all the strings i could it was no use
now you tell me what s happening floyd groaned inwardly
here we go again he said
the sooner i m on that shuttle headed for the moon the happier i ll be
the ah quarantine is purely a safety precaution he said cautiously
we re not even sure it s really necessary but we don t believe in taking chances
but what is the disease what are the symptoms
could it be extraterrestrial
do you want any help from our medical services i m sorry dimitri we ve been asked not to say anything at the moment
thanks for the offer but we can handle the situation hmm said moisevitch obviously quite unconvinced
seems odd to me that you an astronomer should be sent up to the moon to look into an epidemic i m only an ex astronomer it s years since i did any real research
now i m a scientific expert that means i know nothing about absolutely everything then do you know what tma 1 means miller seemed about to choke on his drink but floyd was made of sterner stuff
he looked his old friend straight in the eye and said calmly tma 1
what an odd expression
where did you hear it never mind retorted the russian
you can t fool me
but if you ve run into something you can t handle i hope you don t leave it until too late before you yell for help miller looked meaningfully at his watch
due to board in five minutes dr floyd he said
i think we d better get moving though he knew that they still had a good twenty minutes floyd got up with haste
too much haste for he had forgotten the one sixth of a gravity
he grabbed the table just in time to prevent a takeoff
it was fine meeting you dimitri he said not quite accurately
hope you have a good trip down to earth i ll give you a call as soon as i m back as they left the lounge and checked through the u s transit barrier floyd remarked phew that was close
thanks for rescuing me you know doctor said the security officer i hope he isn t right right about what about us running into something we can t handle that floyd answered with determination is what i intend to find out forty five minutes later the aries lb lunar carrier pulled away from the station
there was none of the power and fury of a takeoff from earth only an almost inaudible far off whistling as the low thrust plasma jets blasted their electrified streams into space
the gentle push lasted for more than fifteen minutes and the mild acceleration would not have prevented anyone from moving around the cabin
but when it was over the ship was no longer bound to earth as it had been while it still accompanied the station
it had broken the bonds of gravity and was now a free and independent planet circling the sun in an orbit of its own
the cabin floyd now had all to himself had been designed for thirty passengers
it was strange and rather lonely to see all the empty seats around him and to have the undivided attention of the steward and stewardess not to mention pilot copilot and two engineers
he doubted that any man in history had ever received such exclusive service and it was most unlikely that anyone would do so in the future
he recalled the cynical remark of one of the less reputable pontiffs now that we have the papacy let us enjoy it well he would enjoy this tip and the euphoria of weightlessness
with the loss of gravity he had at least for a while shed most of his cares
someone had once said that you could be terrified in space but you could not be worried there
it was perfectly true
the stewards it appeared were determined to make him eat for the whole twenty five hours of the trip and he was continually fending off unwanted meals
eating in zero gravity was no real problem contrary to the dark forebodings of the early astronauts
he sat at an ordinary table to which the plates were clipped as aboard ship in a rough sea
all the courses had some element of stickiness so that they would not take off and go wandering round the cabin
thus a chop would be glued to the plate by a thick sauce and a salad kept under control by an adhesive dressing
with a little skill and care there were few items that could not be tackled safely the only things banned were hot soups and excessively crumbly pastries
drinks of course were a different matter all liquids simply had to be kept in plastic squeeze tubes
a whole generation of research by heroic but unsung volunteers had gone into the design of the washroom and it was now considered to be more or less foolproof
floyd investigated it soon after free fall had begun
he found himself in a little cubicle with all the fittings of an ordinary airline toilet but illuminated with a red light that was very harsh and unpleasant to the eye
a notice printed in prominent letters announced most important
for your own comfort please read these instructions carefully
floyd sat down one still tended to do so even when weightless and read the notice several times
when he was sure that there had been no modifications since his last trip he pressed the start button
close at hand an electric motor began to whirr and floyd felt himself moving
as the notice advised him to do he closed his eyes and waited
after a minute a bell chimed softly and he looked around
the light had now changed to a soothing pinkish white but more important he was under gravity again
only the faintest vibration revealed that it was a spurious gravity caused by the carrousel like spin of the whole toilet compartment
floyd picked up a piece of soap and watched it drop in slow motion he judged that the centrifugal force was about a quarter of a normal gravity
but that was quite enough it would ensure that everything moved in the right direction in the one place where this mattered most
he pressed the stop for exit button and closed his eyes again
weight slowly ebbed as the rotation ceased the bell gave a double chime and the red warning light was back
the door was then locked in the right position to let him glide out into the cabin where he adhered as quickly as possible to the carpet
he had long ago exhausted the novelty of weightlessness and was grateful for the velcro slippers that allowed him to walk almost normally
there was plenty to occupy his time even if he did nothing but sit and read
when he tired of official reports and memoranda and minutes he would plug his foolscap sized newspad into the ship s information circuit and scan the latest reports from earth
one by one he would conjure up the world s major electronic papers he knew the codes of the more important ones by heart and had no need to consult the list on the back of his pad
switching to the display unit s short term memory he would hold the front page while he quickly searched the headlines and noted the items that interested him
each had its own two digit reference when he punched that the postage stamp sized rectangle would expand until it neatly filled the screen and he could read it with comfort
when he had finished he would flash back to the complete page and select a new subject for detailed examination
floyd sometimes wondered if the newspad and the fantastic technology behind it was the last word in man s quest for perfect communications
here he was far out in space speeding away from earth at thousands of miles an hour yet in a few milliseconds he could see the headlines of any newspaper he pleased
that very word newspaper of course was an anachronistic hangover into the age of electronics
the text was updated automatically on every hour even if one read only the english versions one could spend an entire lifetime doing nothing but absorbing the ever changing flow of information from the news satellites
it was hard to imagine how the system could be improved or made more convenient
but sooner or later floyd guessed it would pass away to be replaced by something as unimaginable as the newspad itself would have been to caxton or gutenberg
there was another thought which a scanning of those tiny electronic headlines often invoked
the more wonderful the means of communication the more trivial tawdry or depressing its contents seemed to be
accidents crimes natural and man made disasters threats of conflict gloomy editorials these still seemed to be the main concern of the millions of words being sprayed into the ether
yet floyd also wondered if this was altogether a bad thing the newspapers of utopia he had long ago decided would be terribly dull
from time to time the captain and the other members of the crew came into the cabin and exchanged a few words with him
they treated their distinguished passenger with awe and were doubtless burning with curiosity about his mission but were too polite to ask any questions or even to drop any hints
only the charming little stewardess seemed completely at ease in his presence
as floyd quickly discovered she came from bali and had carried beyond the atmosphere some of the grace and mystery of that still largely unspoiled island
one of his strangest and most enchanting memories of the entire trip was her zero gravity demonstration of some classical balinese dance movements with the lovely blue green crescent of the waning earth as a backdrop
there was one sleep period when the main cabin lights were switched off and floyd fastened down his arms and legs with the elastic sheets that would prevent him from drifting away into space
it seemed a crude arrangement but here in zero gravity his unpadded couch was more comfortable than the most luxurious mattress on earth
when he had strapped himself in floyd dozed off quickly enough but woke up once in a drowsy half conscious condition to be completely baffled by his strange surroundings
for a moment he thought that be was in the middle of some dimly lit chinese lantern the faint glow from the other cubicles around him gave that impression
then he said to himself firmly and successfully go to sleep boy
this is just an ordinary moon shuttle when he awoke the moon had swallowed up half the sky and the braking maneuvers were about to begin
the wide arc of windows set in the curving wall of the passenger section now looked out onto the open sky not the approaching globe so he moved into the control cabin
here on the rear view tv screens he could watch the final stages of the descent
the approaching lunar mountains were utterly unlike those of earth they lacked the dazzling caps of snow the green close fitting garments of vegetation the moving crowns of cloud nevertheless the fierce contrasts of light and shadow gave them a strange beauty of their own
the laws of earthly aesthetics did not apply here this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces operating over eons of time unknown to the young verdant earth with its fleeting ice ages its swiftly rising and falling seas its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn
here was age inconceivable but not death for the moon had never lived until now
the descending ship was poised almost above the line dividing night from day and directly below was a chaos of jagged shadows and brilliant isolated peaks catching the first light of the slow lunar dawn
that would be a fearful place to attempt a landing even with all possible electronic aids but they were slowly drifting away from it toward the night side of the moon
then floyd saw as his eyes grew more accustomed to the fainter illumination that the night land was not wholly dark
it was aglow with a ghostly light in which peaks and valleys and plains could be clearly seen
the earth a giant moon to the moon was flooding the land below with its radiance
on the pilot s panel lights flashed above radar screens numbers came and went on computer displays clocking off the distance of the approaching moon
they were still more than a thousand miles away when weight returned as the jets began their gentle but steady deceleration
for ages it seemed the moon slowly expanded across the sky the sun sank below the horizon and at last a single giant crater filled the field of view
the shuttle was falling toward its central peaks and suddenly floyd noticed that near one of those peaks a brilliant light was flashing with a regular rhythm
it might have been an airport beacon back on earth and he stared at it with a tightening of the throat
it was proof that men had established another foothold on the moon
now the crater had expanded so much that its ramparts were slipping below the horizon and the smaller craterlets that peppered its interior were beginning to disclose their real size
some of these tiny though they had seemed from far out in space were miles across and could have swallowed whole cities
under its automatic controls the shuttle was sliding down the starlit sky toward that barren landscape glimmering in the light of the great gibbous earth
now a voice was calling somewhere above the whistle of the jets and the electronic beepings that came and went through the cabin
clavius control to special 14 you are coming in nicely
please make manual check of landing gear lock hydraulic pressure shock pad inflation the pilot pressed sundry switches green lights flashed and he called back all manual checks completed
landing gear lock hydraulic pressure shock pad o k confirmed said the moon and the descent continued wordlessly
though there was still plenty of talking it was all being done by machines flashing binary impulses to one another at a thousand times the rate their slow thinking makers could communicate
some of the mountain peaks were already towering above the shuttle now the ground was only a few thousand feet away and the beacon light was a brilliant star flashing steadily above a group of low buildings and odd vehicles
in the final stage of the descent the jets seemed to be playing some strange tune they pulsed on and off making the last fine adjustments to the thrust
abruptly a swirling cloud of dust hid everything the jets gave one final spurt and the shuttle rocked very slightly like a rowboat when a small wave goes by
it was some minutes before floyd could really accept the silence that now enfolded him and the weak gravity that gripped his limbs
he had made utterly without incident and in little more than one day the incredible journey of which men had dreamed for two thousand years
after a normal routine flight he had landed on the moon
1 clavius base clavius 15 miles in diameter is the second largest crater on the visible face of the moon and lies in the center of the southern highlands
it is very old ages of vulcanism and bombardment from space have scarred its walls and pockmarked its floor
but since the last era of crater formation when the debris from the asteroid belt was still battering the inner planets it had known peace for half a billion years
now there were new strange stirrings on and below its surface for here man was establishing his first permanent bridgehead on the moon
clavius base could in an emergency be entirely self supporting
all the necessities of life were produced from the local rocks after they had been crushed heated and chemically processed
hydrogen oxygen carbon nitrogen phosphorus all these and most of the other elements could be found inside the moon if one knew where to look for them
the base was a closed system like a tiny working model of earth itself recycling all the chemicals of life
the atmosphere was purified in a vast hothouse a large circular room buried just below the lunar surface
under blazing lamps by night and filtered sunlight by day acres of stubby green plants grew in a warm moist atmosphere
they were special mutations designed for the express purpose of replenishing the air with oxygen and providing food as a by product
more food was produced by chemical processing systems and algae culture
although the green scum circulating through yards of transparent plastic tubes would scarcely have appealed to a gourmet the biochemists could convert it into chops and steaks only an expert could distinguish from the real thing
the eleven hundred men and six hundred women who made up the personnel of the base were all highly trained scientists or technicians carefully selected before they had left earth
though lunar living was now virtually free from the hardships disadvantages and occasional dangers of the early days it was still psychologically demanding and not recommended for anyone suffering from claustrophobia
since it was expensive and time consuming to cut a large underground base out of solid rock or compacted lava the standard one man living module was a room only about six feet wide ten feet long and eight feet high
each room was attractively furnished and looked very much like a good motel suite with convertible sofa tv small hi fi set and vision phone
moreover by a simple trick of interior decoration the one unbroken wall could be converted by the flip of a switch into a convincing terrestrial landscape
there was a choice of eight views
this touch of luxury was typical of the base though it was sometimes hard to explain its necessity to the folk back on earth
every man and woman in clavius had cost a hundred thousand dollars in training and transport and housing it was worth a little extra to maintain their peace of mind
this was not art for art s sake but art for the sake of sanity
one of the attractions of life in the base and on the moon as a whole was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well being
however this had its dangers and it was several weeks before an emigrant from earth could adapt to it
on the moon the human body had to learn a whole new set of reflexes
it had for the first time to distinguish between mass and weight
a man who weighed one hundred eighty pounds on earth might be delighted to discover that he weighed only thirty pounds on the moon
as long as he moved in a straight line at a uniform speed he felt a wonderful sense of buoyancy
but as soon as he attempted to change course to turn corners or to stop suddenly then he would find that his full one hundred eighty pounds of mass or inertia was still there
for that was fixed and unalterable the same on earth moon sun or in free space
before one could be properly adapted to lunar living therefore it was essential to learn that all objects were now six times as sluggish as their mere weight would suggest
it was a lesson usually driven home by numerous collisions and hard knocks and old lunar hands kept their distance from newcomers until they were acclimatized
with its complex of workshops offices storerooms computer center generators garage kitchen laboratories and food processing plant clavius base was a miniature world in itself
and ironically many of the skills that had been used to build this underground empire had been developed during the half century of the cold war
any man who had ever worked in a hardened missile site would have felt at home in clavius
here on the moon were the same arts and hardware of underground living and of protection against a hostile environment but here they had been turned to the purposes of peaee
after ten thousand years man had at last found something as exciting as war
unfortunately not all nations had yet realized that fact
the mountains that had been so prominent just before landing had mysteriously disappeared hidden from sight below the steeply curving lunar horizon
around the spacecraft was a flat gray plain brilliantly lit by the slanting earthlight
although the sky was of course completely black only the brighter stars and planets could be seen unless the eyes were shaded from the surface glare
several very odd vehicles were rolling up to the aries lb spaceship cranes hoists servicing trucks some automatic some operated by a driver in a small pressure cabin
most of them moved on balloon tires for this smooth level plain posed no transportation difficulties but one tanker rolled on the peculiar flex wheels which had proved one of the best all purpose ways of getting around on the moon
a series of flat plates arranged in a circle each plate independently mounted and sprung the flex wheel had many of the advantages of the caterpillar track from which it had evolved
it would adapt its shape and diameter to the terrain over which it was moving and unlike a caterpillar track would continue to function even if a few sections were missing
a small bus with an extension tube like a stubby elephant trunk was now nuzzling affectionately up against the spacecraft
a few seconds later there were bangings and bumpings from outside followed by the sound of hissing air as connections were made and pressure was equalized
the inner door of the airlock opened and the welcoming delegation entered
it was led by ralph halvorsen the administrator of the southern province which meant not only the base but also any exploring parties that operated from it
with him was his chief scientist dr roy michaels a grizzled little geophysicist whom floyd knew from previous visits and half a dozen senior scientists and executives
they greeted him with respectful relief from the administrator downward it was obvious that they looked forward to a chance of unloading some of their worries
very pleased to have you with us dr floyd said halvorsen
did you have a good trip excellent floyd answered
it couldn t have been better
the crew looked after me very well he exchanged the usual small talk that courtesy demanded while the bus rolled away from the spacecraft by unspoken agreement no one mentioned the reason for his visit
after traveling a thousand feet from the landing site the bus came to a large sign which read welcome to clavius base u s astronautical engineering corps 1994 it then dived into a cutting which took it quickly below ground level
a massive door opened ahead then closed behind them
this happened again and yet a third time
when the last door had closed there was a great roaring of air and they were back in atmosphere once more in the shirt sleeve environment of the base
after a short walk through a tunnel packed with pipes and cables and echoing hollowly with rhythmic thumpings and throbbings they arrived in executive territory and floyd found himself back in the familiar environment of typewriters office computers girl assistants wall charts and ringing telephones
as they paused outside the door labeled administrator halvorsen said diplomatically dr
floyd and i will be along to the briefing room in a couple of minutes the others nodded made agreeable sounds and drifted off down the corridor
but before halvorsen could usher floyd into his office there was an interruption the door opened and a small figure hurled itself at the administrator
daddy
you ve been topside
and you promised to take me now diana said halvorsen with exasperated tenderness i only said i d take you if i could
but i ve been very busy meeting dr floyd
shake hands with him he s just come from earth the little girl floyd judged that she was about eight extended a limp hand
her face was vaguely familiar and floyd suddenly became aware that the administrator was looking at him with a quizzical smile
with a shock of recollection he understood why
i don t believe it he exclaimed
when i was here last she was just a baby she had her fourth birthday last week halvorsen answered proudly
children grow fast in this low gravity
but they don t age so quickly they ll live longer than we do floyd stared in fascination at the self assured little lady noting the graceful carriage and the unusually delicate bone structure
it s nice to meet you again diana he said
then something perhaps sheer curiosity perhaps politeness impelled him to add would you like to go to earth her eyes widened with astonishment then she shook her head
it s a nasty place you hurt yourself when you fall down
besides there are too many people so here floyd told himself is the first generation of the spaceborn there would be more of them in the years to come
though there was sadness in this thought there was also a great hope
when earth was tamed and tranquil and perhaps a little tired there would still be scope for those who loved freedom for the tough pioneers the restless adventurers
but their tools would not be ax and gun and canoe and wagon they would be nuclear power plant and plasma drive and hydroponic farm
the time was fast approaching when earth like all mothers must say farewell to her children
with a mixture of threats and promises halvorsen managed to evict his determined offspring and led floyd into the office
the administrator s suite was only about fifteen feet square but it managed to contain all the fittings and status symbols of the typical 5 a year head of a department
signed photographs of important politicians including the president of the united states and the secretary general of the united nations adorned one wall while signed photos of celebrated astronauts covered most of another
floyd sank into a comfortable leather chair and was given a glass of sherry courtesy of the lunar biochemical labs
how s it going ralph floyd asked sipping the drink with caution then with approval
not too bad halvorsen replied
however there is something you d better know about before you go in there what is it
well i suppose you could describe it as a morale problem halvorsen sighed
oh it isn t serious yet but it s getting there fast the news blackout floyd said flatly
right halvorsen replied
my people are getting very steamed up about it
after all most of them have families back on earth they probably believe they re all dead of moon plague i m sorry about that said floyd but no one could think of a better cover story and so far it s worked
by the way i met moisevitch at the space station and even he bought it well that should make security happy not too happy he d heard of tma 1 rumors are beginning to leak out
but we just can t issue any statement until we know what the damn thing is and whether our chinese friends are behind it dr
michaels thinks he has the answer to that
he s dying to tell you floyd drained his glass
and i m dying to hear him
let s go 11 anomaly the briefing took place in a large rectangular chamber that could hold a hundred people with ease
it was equipped with the latest optical and electronic displays and would have looked like a model conference room but for the numerous posters pinups notices and amateur paintings which indicated that it was also the center of the local cultural life
floyd was particularly struck by a collection of signs obviously assembled with loving care which carried such messages as please keep off the grass no parking on even days defense de fumer to the beach cattle crossing soft shoulders and do not feed the animals
if these were genuine as they certainly appeared to be their transportation from earth had cost a small fortune
there was a touching defiance about them on this hostile world men could still joke about the things they had been forced to leave behind and which their children would never miss
a crowd of forty or fifty people was waiting for floyd and everyone rose politely as he entered behind the administrator
as he nodded at several familiar faces floyd whispered to halvorsen i d like to say a few words before the briefing floyd sat down in the front row while the administrator ascended the rostrum and looked round his audience
ladies and gentlemen halvorsen began i needn t tell you that this is a very important occasion
we are delighted to have dr heywood floyd with us
we all know him by reputation and many of us are acquainted with him personally
he has just completed a special flight from earth to be here and before the briefing he has a few words for us
dr floyd floyd walked to the rostrum amid a sprinkling of polite applause surveyed the audience with a smile and said thank you i only want to say this
the president has asked me to convey his appreciation of your outstanding work which we hope the world will soon be able to recognize
i m quite aware he continued carefully that some of you perhaps most of you are anxious that the present veil of secrecy be withdrawn you would not be scientists if you thought otherwise he caught a glimpse of dr michaels whose face was creased in a slight frown which brought out a long scar down his right cheek presumably the aftermath of some accident in space
the geologist he was well aware had been protesting vigorously against what he called this cops and robbers nonsense but i would remind you floyd continued that this is a quite extraordinary situation
we must be absolutely sure of our own facts if we make errors now there may be no second chance so please be patient a little longer
those are also the wishes of the president
that s all i have to say
now i m ready for your report he walked back to his seat the administrator said thank you very much dr floyd and nodded rather brusquely to his chief scientist
on cue dr michaels walked up to the rostrum and the lights faded out
a photograph of the moon flashed onto the screen
at the very center of the disk was a brilliant white crater ring from which a striking pattern of rays fanned out
it looked exactly as if someone had hurled a bag of flour at the face of the moon and it had spattered out in all directions
this is tycho said michaels pointing to the central crater
on this vertical photograph tycho is even more conspicuous than when seen from earth then it s rather near the edge of the moon
but observed from this viewpoint looking straight down from a thousand miles up you ll see how it dominates an entire hemisphere he let floyd absorb this unfamiliar view of a familiar object then continued during the past year we have been conducting a magnetic survey of the region from a low level satellite
it was completed only last month and this is the result the map that started all the trouble another picture flashed on the screen it looked like a contour map though it showed magnetic intensity not heights above sea level
for the most part the lines were roughly parallel and spaced well apart but in one corner of the map they became suddenly packed together to form a series of concentric circles like a drawing of a knothole in a piece of wood
even to an untrained eye it was obvious that something peculiar had happened to the moon s magnetic field in this region and in large letters across the bottom of the map were the words tycho magnetic anomaly one tma l
stamped on the top right was classified
at first we thought it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock but all the geological evidence was against it
and not even a big nickel iron meteorite could produce a field as intense as this so we decided to have a look
the first party discovered nothing just the usual level terrain buried beneath a very thin layer of moon dust
they sank a drill in the exact center of the magnetic field to get a core sample for study
twenty feet down the drill stopped
so the survey party started to dig not an easy job in spacesuits as i can assure you
what they found brought them back to base in a hurry
we sent out a bigger team with better equipment
they excavated for two weeks with the result you know the darkened assembly room became suddenly hushed and expectant as the picture on the screen changed
though everyone had seen it many times there was not a person who failed to crane forward as if hoping to find new details
on earth and moon less than a hundred people had so far been allowed to set eyes on this photograph
it showed a man in a bright red and yellow spacesuit standing at the bottom of an excavation and supporting a surveyor s rod marked off in tenths of a meter
it was obviously a night shot and might have been taken anywhere on the moon or mars
but until now no planet had ever produced a scene like this
the object before which the spacesuited man was posing was a vertical slab of jet black material about ten feet high and five feet wide it reminded floyd somewhat ominously of a giant tombstone
perfectly sharp edged and symmetrical it was so black it seemed to have swallowed up the light falling upon it there was no surface detail at all
it was impossible to tell whether it was made of stone or metal or plastic or some material altogether unknown to man
tma 1 dr michaels declared almost reverently
it looks brand new doesn t it
i can hardly blame those who thought it was just a few years old and tried to connect it with the third chinese expedition back in 98
but i never believed that and now we ve been able to date it positively from local geological evidence
my colleagues and i dr floyd will stake our reputations on this
tma l has nothing to do with the chinese
indeed it has nothing to do with the human race for when it was buried there were no humans
you see it is approximately three million years old
what you are now looking at is the first evidence of intelligent life beyond the earth 12 journey by earthlight macro crater province extends s from near center of visible face of moon e of central crater province
densely pocked with impact craters many large and including the largest on moon in n some craters fractured from impact forming mare imbrium
rough surfaces almost everywhere except for some crater bottoms
most surfaces in slopes mostly 1 to 12 some crater bottoms nearly level
landing and movement landing generally difficult because of rough sloping surfaces less difficult in some level crater bottoms
movement possible almost everywhere but route selection required less difficult on some level crater bottoms
construction generally moderately difficult because of slope and numerous large blocks in loose material excavation of lava difficult in some crater bottoms

extract from engineer special study of the surface of the moon office chief of engineers department of the army
u s geological survey washington 1961
the mobile lab now rolling across the crater plain at fifty miles an hour looked rather like an outsized trailer mounted on eight flex wheels
but it was very much more than this it was a self contained base in which twenty men could live and work for several weeks
indeed it was virtually a landgoing spaceship and in an emergency it could even fly
if it came to a crevasse or canyon which was too large to detour and too steep to enter it could hop across the obstacle on its four underjets
as he peered out of the window floyd could see stretching ahead of him a well defined trail where dozens of vehicles had left a hard packed band in the friable surface of the moon
at regular intervals along the track were tall slender rods each carrying a flashing light
no one could possibly get lost on the 2 mile journey from clavius base to tma 1 even though it was still night and the sun would not rise for several hours
the stars overhead were only a little brighter or more numerous than on a clear night from the high plateaus of new mexico or colorado
but there were two things in that coal black sky that destroyed any illusion of earth
the first was earth itself a blazing beacon hanging above the northern horizon
the light pouring down from that giant half globe was dozens of times more brilliant than the full moon and it covered all this land with a cold blue green phosphorescence
the second celestial apparition was a faintt pearly cone of light slanting up the eastern sky
it became brighter and brighter toward the horizon hinting of great fires just concealed below the edge of the moon
here was a pale glory that no man had ever seen from earth save during the few moments of a total eclipse
it was the corona harbinger of the lunar dawn giving notice that before long the sun would smite this sleeping land
as he sat with halvorsen and michaels in the forward observation lounge immediately beneath the driver s position floyd found his thoughts turning again and again to the three million year wide gulf that had just opened up before him
like all scientifically literate men he was used to considering far longer periods of time but they had concerned only the movements of stars and the slow cycles of the inanimate universe
mind or intelligence had not been involved those eons were empty of all that touched the emotions
three million years
the infinitely crowded panorama of written history with its empires and its kings its triumphs and its tragedies covered barely one thousandth of this appalling span of time
not only man himself but most of the animals now alive on earth did not even exist when this black enigma was so carefully buried here in the most brilliant and most spectacular of all the craters of the moon
that it had been buried and quite deliberately dr michaels was absolutely sure
at first he explained i rather hoped it might mark the site of some underground structure but our latest excavations have eliminated that
it s sitting on a wide platform of the same black material with undisturbed rock beneath it
the creatures who designed it wanted to make sure it stayed put barring major moonquakes
they were building for eternity
there was triumph and yet sadness in michaels voice and floyd could share both emotions
at last one of man s oldest questions had been answered here was the proof beyond all shadow of doubt that his was not the only intelligence that the universe had brought forth
but with that knowledge there came again an aching awareness of the immensity of time
whatever had passed this way had missed mankind by a hundred thousand generations
perhaps floyd told himself it was just as well
and yet what we might have learned from creatures who could cross space while our ancestors were still living in trees
a few hundred yards ahead a signpost was coming up over the moon s strangely close horizon
at its base was a tent shaped structure covered with shining silver foil obviously for protection against the fierce heat of day
as the bus rolled by floyd was able to read in the brilliant earthlight emergency depot no
3 2 kilos lox 1 kilos water 2 foodpaks mk 4 1 toolkit type b 1 suit repair outfit
telephone
have you thought of that asked floyd pointing out of the window
suppose the thing s a supply cache left behind by an expedition that never returned it s a possibility admitted michaels
that magnetic field certainly labeled its position so that it could be easily found
but it s rather small it couldn t hold much in the way of supplies why not interjected halvorsen
who knows bow big they were
perhaps they were only six inches tall which would make the thing twenty or thirty stories high michaels shook his head
out of the question he protested
you can t have very small intelligent creatures you need a minimum brain size michaels and halvorsen floyd had noticed usually took opposing viewpoints yet there appeared to be little personal hostility or friction between them
they seemed to respect each other and simply agreed to disagree
there was certainly little agreement anywhere about the nature of tma 1 or the tycho monolith as some preferred to call it retaining part of the abbreviation
in the six hours since he had landed on the moon floyd had heard a dozen theories but had committed himself to none
shrine survey marker tomb geophysical instrument these were perhaps the favorite suggestions and some of the protagonists grew very heated in their defense
a good many bets had already been placed and a lot of money would change hands when the truth was finally known if indeed it ever was
so far the hard black material of the slab had resisted all the rather mild attempts that michaels and his colleagues had made to obtain samples
they had no doubt that a laser beam would cut into it for surely nothing could resist that frightful concentration of energy but the decision to employ such violent measures would be left to floyd
he had already decided that x rays sonic probes neutron beams and all other nondestructive means of investigation would be brought into play before he called up the heavy artillery of the laser
it was the mark of a barbarian to destroy something one could not understand but perhaps men were barbarians beside the creatures who had made this thing
and where could they have come from
the moon itself
no that was utterly impossible
if there had ever been indigenous life on this barren world it had been destroyed during the last crater forming epoch when most of the lunar surface was white hot
earth
very unlikely though perhaps not quite impossible
any advanced terrestrial civilization presumably a nonhuman one back in the pleistocene era would have left many other traces of its existence
we would have known all about it thought floyd long before we got to the moon
that left two alternatives the planets and the stars
yet all the evidence was against intelligent life elsewhere in the solar system or indeed life of any kind except on earth and mars
the inner planets were too hot the outer ones far too cold unless one descended into their atmosphere to depths where the pressures amounted to hundreds of tons to the square inch
so perhaps these visitors had come from the stars yet that was even more incredible
as he looked up at the constellations strewn across the ebon lunar sky floyd remembered how often his fellow scientists had proved that interstellar travel was impossible
the journey from earth to moon was still fairly impressive but the very nearest star was a hundred million times more distant
speculation was a waste of time he must wait until there was more evidence please fasten your seat belts and secure all loose objects said the cabin speaker suddenly
forty degree slope approaching two marker posts with winking lights had appeared on the horizon and the bus was steering between them
floyd had barely adjusted his straps when the vehicle slowly edged itself over the brink of a really terrifying incline and began to descend a long rubble covered slope as steep as the roof of a house
the slanting earth light coming from behind them now gave very little illumination and the bus s own floodlights had been switched on
many years ago floyd had stood on the lip of vesuvius staring into the crater he could easily imagine that he was now driving down into it and the sensation was not a very pleasant one
they were descending one of the inner terraces of tycho and it leveled out again some thousand feet below
as they crawled down the slope michaels pointed out across the great expanse of plain now spread out beneath them
there they are he exclaimed
floyd nodded he had already noticed the cluster of red and green lights several miles ahead and kept his eyes fixed upon it as the bus edged its way delicately down the slope
the big vehicle was obviously under perfect control but he did not breathe easily until it was once more on an even keel
now he could see glistening like silver bubbles in the earthlight a group of pressure domes the temporary shelters housing the workers on the site
near these was a radio tower a drilling rig a group of parked vehicles and a large pile of broken rock presumably the material that had been excavated to reveal the monolith
this tiny camp in the wilderness looked very lonely very vulnerable to the forces of nature ranged silently around it
there was no sign of life and no visible hint as to why men had come here so far from home
you can just see the crater said michaels
over there on the right about a hundred yards from that radio antenna so this is it thought floyd as the bus rolled past the pressure domes and came to the lip of the crater
his pulse quickened as he craned forward for a better view
the vehicle began to creep cautiously down a ramp of hard packed rock into the interior of the crater
and there exactly as he had seen it in the photographs was tma 1
floyd stared blinked shook his head and stared again
even in the brilliant earthlight it was hard to see the object clearly his first impression was of a flat rectangle that might have been cut out of carbon paper it seemed to have no thickness at all
of course this was an optical illusion though he was looking at a solid body it reflected so little light that he could see it only in silhouette
the passengers were utterly silent as the bus descended into the crater
there was awe and there was also incredulity sheer disbelief that the dead moon of all worlds could have sprung this fantastic surprise
the bus came to a halt within twenty feet of the slab and broadside on so that all the passengers could examine it
yet beyond the geometrically perfect shape of the thing there was little to see
nowhere were there any marks or any abatement of its ultimate ebon blackness
it was the very crystallization of night and for one moment floyd wondered if it could indeed be some extraordinary natural formation born of the fires and pressures attending the creation of the moon
but that remote possibility he knew had already been examined and dismissed
at some signal floodlights around the lip of the crater were switched on and the bright earthlight was obliterated by a far more brilliant glare
in the lunar vacuum the beams were of course completely invisible they formed overlapping ellipses of blinding white centered on the monolith
and where they touched it its ebon surface seemed to swallow them
pandora s box thought floyd with a sudden sense of foreboding waiting to be opened by inquisitive man
and what will he find inside
13 the slow dawn the main pressure dome at the tma 1 site was only twenty feet across and its interior was uncomfortably crowded
the bus coupled to it through one of the two airlocks gave some much appreciated extra living room
inside this hemispherical double walled balloon lived worked and slept the six scientists and technicians now permanently attached to the project
it also contained most of their equipment and instruments all the stores that could not be left in the vacuum outside cooking washing and toilet facilities geological samples and a small tv screen through which the site could be kept under continuous surveillance
floyd was not surprised when halvorsen elected to remain in the dome he stated his views with admirable frankness
i regard spacesuits as a necessary evil said the administrator i wear one four times a year for my quarterly checkout tests
if you don t mind i ll sit here and watch over the tv some of this prejudice was now unjustified for the latest models were infinitely more comfortable than the clumsy suits of armor worn by the first lunar explorers
they could be put on in less than a minute even without help and were quite automatic
the mk v into which floyd was now carefully sealed would protect him from the worst that the moon could do either by day or by night
accompanied by dr michaels he walked into the small airlock
as the throbbing of the pumps died away and his suit stiffened almost imperceptibly around him he felt himself enclosed in the silence of vacuum
that silence was broken by the welcome sound of his suit radio
pressure o k dr floyd
are you breathing normally yes i m fine his companion carefully checked the dials and gauges on the outside of floyd s suit
then he said o k let s go the outer door opened and the dusty moonscape lay before them glimmering in the earthlight
with a cautious waddling movement floyd followed michaels through the lock
it was not hard to walk indeed in a paradoxical way the suit made him feel more at home than at any time since reaching the moon
its extra weight and the slight resistance it imposed on his motion gave some of the illusion of the lost terrestrial gravity
the scene had changed since the party had arrived barely an hour ago
though the stars and the half earth were still as bright as ever the fourteen day lunar night had almost ended
the glow of the corona was like a false moonrise along the eastern sky and then without warning the tip of the radio mast a hundred feet above floyd s head suddenly seemed to burst into flame as it caught the first rays of the hidden sun
they waited while the project supervisor and two of his assistants emerged from the airlock then walked slowly toward the crater
by the time they had reached it a thin bow of unbearable incandescence had thrust itself above the eastern horizon
though it would take more than an hour for the sun to clear the edge of the slowly turning moon the stars were already banished
the crater was still in shadow but the floodlights mounted around its rim lit the interior brilliantly
as floyd walked slowly down the ramp toward the black rectangle he felt a sense not only of awe but of helplessness
here at the very portals of earth man was already face to face with a mystery that might never be solved
three million years ago something had passed this way had left this unknown and perhaps unknowable symbol of its purpose and had returned to the planets or to the stars
floyd s suit radio interrupted his reverie
project supervisor speaking
if you d all line up on this side we d like to take a few photos
dr floyd will you stand in the middle dr michaels thank you
no one except floyd seemed to think that there was anything funny about this
in all honesty he had to admit that he was glad someone had brought a camera here was a photo that would undoubtedly be historic and he wanted copies for himself
he hoped that his face would be clearly visible through the helmet of the suit
thanks gentlemen said the photographer after they had posed somewhat self consciously in front of the monolith and he had made a dozen exposures
we ll ask the base photo section to send you copies then floyd turned his full attention to the ebon slab walking slowly around it examining it from every angle trying to imprint its strangeness upon his mind
he did not expect to find anything for he knew that every square inch had already been gone over with microscopic care
now the sluggish sun had lifted itself above the edge of the crater and its rays were pouring almost broadside upon the eastern face of the block
yet it seemed to absorb every particle of light as if it had never been
floyd decided to try a simple experiment he stood between the monolith and the sun and looked for his own shadow on the smooth black sheet
there was no trace of it
at least ten kilowatts of raw heat must be falling on the slab if there was anything inside it must be rapidly cooking
how strange floyd thought to stand here while this thing is seeing daylight for the first time since the ice ages began on earth
he wondered again about its black color that was ideal of course for absorbing solar energy
but he dismissed the thought at once for who would be crazy enough to bury a sunpowered device twenty feet underground
he looked up at the earth beginning to wane in the morning sky
only a handful of the six billion people there knew of this discovery how would the world react to the news when it was finally released
the political and social implications were immense every person of real intelligence everyone who looked an inch beyond his nose would find his life his values his philosophy subtly changed
even if nothing whatsoever was discovered about tma 1 and it remained an eternal mystery man would know that he was not unique in the universe
though he had missed them by millions of years those who had once stood here might yet return and if not there might well be others
all futures must now contain this possibility
floyd was still musing over these thoughts when his helmet speaker suddenly emitted a piercing electronic shriek like a hideously overloaded and distorted time signal
involuntarily he tried to block his ears with his spacesuited hands then he recovered and groped frantically for the gain control of his receiver
while he was still fumbling four more of the shrieks blasted out of the ether then there was a merciful silence
all around the crater figures were standing in attitudes of paralyzed astonishment
so it s nothing wrong with my gear floyd told himself everyone heard those piercing electronic screams
after three million years of darkness tma 1 had greeted the lunar dawn
14 the listeners a hundred million miles beyond mars in the cold loneliness where no man had yet traveled deep space monitor 79 drifted slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids
for three years it had fulfilled its mission flawlessly a tribute to the american scientists who had designed it the british engineers who had built it the russian technicians who had launched it
a delicate spider s web of antennas sampled the passing waves of radio noise the ceaseless crackle and hiss of what pascal in a far simpler age had naively called the silence of infinite space radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond neutron and x ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would ever see magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds as the sun breathed million mile an hour blasts of tenuous plasma into the faces of its circling children
all these things and many others were patiently noted by deep space monitor 79 and recorded in its crystalline memory
one of its antennas by now unconsidered miracles of electronics was always aimed at a point never far from the sun
every few months its distant target could have been seen had there been any eye here to watch as a bright star with a close fainter companion but most of the time it was lost in the solar glaze
to that far off planet earth every twenty four hours the monitor would send the information it had patiently garnered packed neatly into one five minute pulse
about a quarter of an hour late traveling at the speed of light that pulse would reach its destination
the machines whose duty it was would be waiting for it they would amplify and record the signal and add it to the thousands of miles of magnetic tape now stored in the vaults of the world space centers at washington moscow and canberra
since the first satellites had orbited almost fifty years earlier trillions and quadrillions of pulses of information had been pouring down from space to be stored against the day when they might contribute to the advance of knowledge
only a minute fraction of all this raw material would ever be processed but there was no way of telling what observation some scientist might wish to consult ten or fifty or a hundred years from now
so everything had to be kept on file stacked in endless air conditioned galleries triplicated at the three centers against the possibility of accidental loss
it was part of the real treasure of mankind more valuable than all the gold locked uselessly away in bank vaults
and now deep space monitor 19 had noted something strange a faint yet unmistakable disturbance rippling across the solar system and quite unlike any natural phenomenon it had ever observed in the past
automatically it recorded the direction the time the intensity in a few hours it would pass the information to earth
as also would orbiter m 15 circling mars twice a day and high inclination probe 21 climbing slowly above the plane of the ecliptic and even artificial comet 5 heading out into the cold wastes beyond pluto along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years
all noted the peculiar burst of energy that had disturbed their instruments all in due course reported back automatically to the memory stores on distant earth
the computers might never have perceived the connection between four peculiar sets of signals from space probes on independent orbits millions of miles apart
but as soon as he glanced at his morning report the radiation forecaster at goddard knew that something strange had passed through the solar system during the last twenty four hours
he had only part of its track but when the computer projected it on the planet situation board it was as clear and unmistakable as a vapor trail across a cloudless sky or a single line of footprints over a field of virgin snow
some immaterial pattern of energy throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat had leaped from the face of the moon and was heading out toward the stars
iii between planets 15 discovery the ship was still only thirty days from earth yet david bowman sometimes found it hard to believe that be had ever known any other existence than the closed little world of discovery
all his years of training all his earlier missions to the moon and mars seemed to belong to another man in another life
frank poole admitted to the same feelings and had sometimes jokingly regretted that the nearest psychiatrist was the better part of a hundred million miles away
but this sense of isolation and estrangement was easy enough to understand and certainly indicated no abnormality
in the fifty years since men had ventured into space there had never been a mission quite like this
it had begun five years ago as project jupiter the first manned round trip to the greatest of the planets
the ship was nearly ready for the two year voyage when somewhat abruptly the mission profile had been changed
discovery would still go to jupiter but she would not stop there
she would not even slacken speed as she raced through the far ranging jovian satellite system
on the contrary she would use the gravitational field of the giant world us a sling to cast her even farther from the sun
like a comet she would streak on across the outer reaches of the solar system to her ultimate goal the ringed glory of saturn
and she would never return
for discovery it would be a one way trip yet her crew had no intention of committing suicide
if all went well they would be back on earth within seven years five of which would pass like a flash in the dreamless sleep of hibernation while they awaited rescue by the still unbuilt discovery ii
the word rescue was carefully avoided in all the astronautics agency s statements and documents it implied some failure of planning and the approved jargon was re acquisition if anything went really wrong there would certainly be no hope of rescue almost a billion miles from earth
it was a calculated risk like all voyages into the unknown
but half a century of research had proved that artificially induced human hibernation was perfectly safe and it had opened up new possibilities in space travel
not until this mission however had they been exploited to the utmost
the three members of the survey team who would not be needed until the ship entered her final orbit around saturn would sleep through the entire outward flight
tons of food and other expendables would thus be saved almost as important the team would be fresh and alert and not fatigued by the ten month voyage when they went into action
discovery would enter a parking orbit around saturn becoming a new moon of the giant planet
she would swing back and forth along a two million mile ellipse that took her close to saturn and then across the orbits of all its major moons
they would have a hundred days in which to map and study a world with eighty times the area of earth and surrounded by a retinue of at least fifteen known satellites one of them as large as the planet mercury
there must be wonders enough here for centuries of study the first expedition could only carry out a preliminary reconnaissance
all that it found would be radioed back to earth even if the explorers never returned their discoveries would not be lost
at the end of the hundred days discovery would close down
all the crew would go into hibernation only the essential systems would continue to operate watched over by the ship s tireless electronic brain
she would continue to swing around saturn on an orbit now so well determined that men would know exactly where to look for her a thousand years hence
but in only five years according to present plans discovery ii would come
even if six or seven or eight years elapsed her sleeping passengers would never know the difference
for all of them the clock would have stopped as it had stopped already for whitehead kaminski and hunter
sometimes bowman as first captain of discovery envied his three unconscious colleagues in the frozen peace of the hibernaculum
they were free from all boredom and all responsibility until they reached saturn the external world did not exist
but that world was watching them through their bio sensor displays
tucked inconspicuously away among the massed instrumentation of the control deck were five small panels marked hunter whitehead kaminski poole bowman
the last two were blank and lifeless their time would not come until a year from now
the others bore constellations of tiny green lights announcing that everything was well and on each was a small display screen across which sets of glowing lines traced the leisurely rhythms that indicated pulse respiration and brain activity
there were times when bowman well aware how unnecessary this was for the alarm would sound instantly if anything was wrong would switch over to audio output
he would listen half hypnotized to the infinitely slow heartbeats of his sleeping colleagues keeping his eyes fixed on the sluggish waves that marched in synchronism across the screen
most fascinating of all were the eeg displays the electronic signatures of three personalities that had once existed and would one day exist again
they were almost free from the spikes and valleys the electrical explosions that marked the activity of the waking brain or even of the brain in normal sleep
if there was any wisp of consciousness remaining it was beyond the reach of instruments and of memory
this last fact bowman knew from personal experience
before he was chosen for this mission his reactions to hibernation had been tested
he was not sure whether he had lost a week of his life or whether he had postponed his eventual death by the same amount of time
when the electrodes had been attached to his forehead and the sleep generator had started to pulse he had seen a brief display of kaleidoscopic patterns and drifting stars
then they had faded and darkness had engulfed him
he had never felt the injections still less the first touch of cold as his body temperature was reduced to only a few degrees above freezing
he awoke and it seemed that he had scarcely closed his eyes
but he knew that was an illusion somehow he was convinced that years had really passed
had the mission been completed
had they already reached saturn carried out their survey and gone into hibernation
was discovery ii here to take them back to earth
he lay in a dreamlike haze utterly unable to distinguish between real and false memories
he opened his eyes but there was little to see except a blurred constellation of lights which puzzled him for some minutes
then he realized that he was looking at the indicator lamps on a ship situation board but it was impossible to focus on them
he soon gave up the attempt
warm air was blowing across him removing the chill from his limbs
there was quiet but stimulating music welling from a speaker behind his head
it was slowly growing louder and louder
then a relaxed friendly but he knew computer generated voice spoke to him
you are becoming operational dave
do not get up or attempt any violent movements
do not try to speak do not get up
thought bowman
that was funny
he doubted if he could wriggle a finger
rather to his surprise he found that he could
he felt quite contented in a dazed stupid kind of way
he knew dimly that the rescue ship must have come that the automatic revival sequence had been triggered and that soon he would be seeing other human beings
that was fine but he did not get excited about it
presently he felt hunger
the computer of course had anticipated this need
there is a signal button by your right hand dave
if you are hungry please press it
bowman forced his fingers to hunt around and presently discovered the pear shaped bulb
he had forgotten all about it though he must have known it was there
how much else had he forgotten did hibernation erase memory
he pressed the button and waited
several minutes later a metal arm moved out from the bunk and a plastic nipple descended toward his lips
he sucked on it eagerly and a warm sweet fluid coursed down his throat brining renewed strength with every drop
presently it went away and he rested once more
he could move his arms and legs now the thought of walking was no longer an impossible dream
though he felt his strength swiftly returning he would have been content to lie here forever if there had been no further stimulus from outside
but presently another voice spoke to him and this time it was wholly human not a construct of electrical pulses assembled by a more than human memory
it was also a familiar voice though it was some time before he could recognize it hello dave
you re coming round fine
you can talk now
do you know where you are he worried about this for some time
if he was really orbiting saturn what had happened during all the months since he had left earth
again he began to wonder if he was suffering from amnesia paradoxically that very thought reassured him if he could remember the word amnesia his brain must be in fairly good shape
but he still did not know where he was and the speaker at the other end of the circuit must have understood his situation completely
don t worry dave
this is frank poole
i m watching your heart and respiration everything is perfectly normal
just relax take it easy
we re going to open the door now and pull you out soft light flooded into the chamber he saw moving shapes silhouetted against the widening entrance
and in that moment all his memories came back to him and be knew exactly where he was
though he had come back safely from the furthest borders of sleep and the nearest borders of death he had been gone only a week
when he left the hibernaculum he would not see the cold saturnian sky that was more than a year in the future and a billion miles away
he was still in the trainer at the houston space flight center under the hot texas sun
16 hal but now texas was invisible and even the united states was hard to see
though the low thrust plasma drive had long since been closed down discovery was still coasting with her slender arrowlike body pointed away from earth and all her high powered optical gear was oriented toward the outer planets where her destiny lay
there was one telescope however that was permanently aimed at earth
it was mounted like a gunsight on the rim of the ship s long range antenna and checked that the great parabolic bowl was rigidly locked upon its distant target
while earth remained centered in the crosswires the vital communication link was intact and messages could come and go along the invisible beam that lengthened more than two million miles with every day that passed
at least once in every watch period bowman would lock homeward through the antenna alignment telescope
as earth was now far back toward the sun its darkened hemisphere faced discovery and on the central display screen the planet appeared as a dazzling silver crescent like another venus
it was rare that any geographical features could be identified in that ever shrinking arc of light for cloud and haze concealed them but even the darkened portion of the disk was endlessly fascinating
it was sprinkled with shining cities sometimes they burned with a steady light sometimes they twinkled like fireflies as atmospheric tremors passed over them
there were also periods when as the moon swung back and forth in its orbit it shone down like a great lamp upon the darkened seas and continents of earth
then with a thrill of recognition bowman could often glimpse familiar coastlines shining in that spectral lunar light
and sometimes when the pacific was calm he could even see the moonglow shimmering across its face and he would remember nights beneath the palm trees of tropical lagoons
yet he had no regrets for these lost beauties
he had enjoyed them all in his thirty five years of life and he was determined to enjoy them again when he returned rich and famous
meanwhile distance made them all the more precious
the sixth member of the crew cared for none of these things for it was not human
it was the highly advanced hal 9 computer the brain and nervous system of the ship
hal for heuristically programmed algorithmic computer no less was a masterwork of the third computer breakthrough
these seemed to occur at intervals of twenty years and the thought that another one was now imminent already worried a great many people
the first had been in the 194 s when the long obsolete vacuum tube had made possible such clumsy high speed morons as eniac and its successors
then in the 196 s solid state microelectronics had been perfected
with its advent it was clear that artificial intelligences at least as powerful as man s need be no larger than office desks if one only knew how to construct them
probably no one would ever know this it did not matter
in the 198 s minsky and good had shown how neural networks could be generated automatically self replicated in accordance with any arbitrary learning program
artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain
in any given case the precise details would never be known and even if they were they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding
whatever way it worked the final result was a machine intelligence that could reproduce some philosophers still preferred to use the word mimic most of the activities of the human brain and with far greater speed and reliability
it was extremely expensive and only a few units of the hal9 series had yet been built but the old jest that it would always be easier to make organic brains by unskilled labor was beginning to sound a little hollow
hal had been trained for this mission as thoroughly as his human colleagues and at many times their rate of input for in addition to his intrinsic speed he never slept
his prime task was to monitor the life support systems continually checking oxygen pressure temperature hull leakage radiation and all the other interlocking factors upon which the lives of the fragile human cargo depended
he could carry out the intricate navigational corrections and execute the necessary flight maneuvers when it was time to change course
and he could watch over the hibernators making any necessary adjustments to their environment and doling out the minute quantities of intravenous fluids that kept them alive
the first generations of computers had received their inputs through glorified typewriter keyboards and had replied through high speed printers and visual displays
hal could do this when necessary but most of his communication with his shipmates was by means of the spoken word
poole and bowman could talk to hal as if he were a human being and he would reply in the perfect idiomatic english he had learned during the fleeting weeks of his electronic childhood
whether hal could actually think was a question which had been settled by the british mathematician alan turing back in the 194 s
turing had pointed out that if one could carry out a prolonged conversation with a machine whether by typewriter or microphone was immaterial without being able to distinguish between its replies and those that a man might give then the machine was thinking by any sensible definition of the word
hal could pass the turing test with ease
the time might even come when hal would take command of the ship
in an emergency if no one answered his signals he would attempt to wake the sleeping members of the crew by electrical and chemical stimulation
if they did not respond he would radio earth for further orders
and then if there was no reply from earth he would take what measures he deemed necessary to safeguard the ship and to continue the mission whose real purpose he alone knew and which his human colleagues could never have guessed
poole and bowman had often humorously referred to themselves as caretakers or janitors aboard a ship that could really run itself
they would have been astonished and more than a little indignant to discover how much truth that jest contained
17 cruise mode the day by day running of the ship had been planned with great care and theoretically at least bowman and poole knew what they would be doing at every moment of the twenty four hours
they operated on a twelve hours on twelve hours off basis taking charge alternately and never being both asleep at the same time
the officer on duty remained on the control deck while his deputy saw to the general housekeeping inspected the ship coped with the odd jobs that constantly arose or relaxed in his cubicle
although bowman was nominal captain on this phase of the mission no outside observer could have deduced the fact
he and poole switched roles rank and responsibilities completely every twelve hours
this kept them both at peak training minimized the chances of friction and helped toward the goal of 1 percent redundancy
bowman s day began at 6 ship s time the universal ephemeris time of the astronomers
if he was late hal had a variety of beeps and chimes to remind him of his duty but they had never been used
as a test poole had once switched off the alarm bowman had still risen automatically at the right time
his first official act of the day would be to advance the master hibernation timer twelve hours
if this operation was missed twice in a row hal would assume that both he and poole had been incapacitated and would take the necessary emergency action
bowman would attend to his toilet and do his isometric exercises before settling down to breakfast and the morning s radio fax edition of the world times
on earth he never read the paper as carefully as he did now even the smallest items of society gossip the most fleeting political rumors seemed of absorbing interest as it flashed across the screen
at 7 he would officially relieve poole on the control deck bringing him a squeeze tube of coffee from the kitchen
if as was usually the case there was nothing to report and no action to be taken he would settle down to check all the instrument readings and would run through a series of tests designed to spot possible malfunctions
by 1 this would be finished and he would start on a study period
bowman had been a student for more than half his life he would continue to be one until he retired
thanks to the twentieth century revolution in training and information handling techniques he already possessed the equivalent of two or three college educations and what was more he could remember 9 percent of what he had learned
fifty years ago he would have been considered a specialist in applied astronomy cybernetics and space propulsion systems yet he was prone to deny with genuine indignation that he was a specialist at all
bowman had never found it possible to focus his interest exclusively on any subject despite the dark warnings of his instructors he had insisted on taking his master s degree in general astronautics a course with a vague and woolly syllabus designed for those whose iqs were in the low 13 s and who would never reach the top ranks of their profession
his decision had been right that very refusal to specialize had made him uniquely qualified for his present task
in much the same way frank poole who sometimes disparagingly called himself general practitioner in space biology had been an ideal choice as his deputy
the two of them with if necessary help from hal s vast stores of information could cope with any problems likely to arise during the voyage as long as they kept their minds alert and receptive and continually reengraved old patterns of memory
so for two hours from 1 to 12 bowman would engage in a dialogue with an electronic tutor checking his general knowledge or absorbing material specific to this mission
he would prowl endlessly over ship s plans circuit diagrams and voyage profiles or would try to assimilate all that was known about jupiter saturn and their far ranging families of moons
at midday he would retire to the galley and leave the ship to hal while he prepared his lunch
even here he was still fully in touch with events for the tiny lounge cum dining room contained a duplicate of the situation display panel and hal could call him at a moment s notice
poole would join him for this meal before retiring for his six hour sleep period and usually they would watch one of the regular tv programs beamed to them from earth
their menus had been planned with as much care as any part of the mission the food most of it freeze dried was uniformly excellent and had been chosen for the minimum of trouble packets had merely to be opened and popped into the tiny auto galley which beeped for attention when the job was done
they could enjoy what tasted like and equally important looked like orange juice eggs any style steaks chops roasts fresh vegetables assorted fruits ice cream and even freshly baked bread
after lunch from 13 to 16 bowman would make a slow and careful tour of the ship or such part of it as was accessible
discovery measured almost four hundred feet from end to end but the little universe occupied by her crew lay entirely inside the forty foot sphere of the pressure hull
here were all the life support systems and the control deck which was the operational heart of the ship
below this was a small space garage fitted with three airlocks through which powered capsules just large enough to hold a man could sail out into the void if the need arose for extravehicular activity
the equatorial region of the pressure sphere the slice as it were from capricorn to cancer enclosed a slowly rotating drum thirty five feet in diameter
as it made one revolution every ten seconds this carrousel or centrifuge produced an artificial gravity equal to that of the moon
this was enough to prevent the physical atrophy which would result from the complete absence of weight and it also allowed the routine functions of living to be carried out under normal or nearly normal conditions
the carrousel therefore contained the kitchen dining washing and toilet facilities
only here was it safe to prepare and handle hot drinks quite dangerous in weightless conditions where one can be badly scalded by floating globules of boiling water
the problem of shaving was also solved there would be no weightless bristles drifting around to endanger electrical equipment and produce a health hazard
around the rim of the carrousel were five tiny cubicles fitted out by each astronaut according to taste and containing his personal belongings
only bowman s and poole s were now in use while the future occupants of the other three cabins reposed in their electronic sarcophagi next door
the spin of the carrousel could be stopped if necessary when this happened its angular momentum had to be stored in a flywheel and switched back again when rotation was restarted
but normally it was left running at constant speed for it was easy enough to enter the big slowly turning drum by going hand over hand along a pole through the zero gee region at its center
transferring to the moving section was as easy and automatic after a little experience as stepping onto a moving escalator
the spherical pressure hull formed the head of a flimsy arrow shaped structure more than a hundred yards long
discovery like all vehicles intended for deep space penetration was too fragile and unstreamlined ever to enter an atmosphere or to defy the full gravitational field of any planet
she had been assembled in orbit around the earth tested on a translunar maiden flight and finally checked out in orbit above the moon
she was a creature of pure space and she looked it
immediately behind the pressure hull was grouped a cluster of four large liquid hydrogen tanks and beyond them forming a long slender v were the radiating fins that dissipated the waste heat of the nuclear reactor
veined with a delicate tracery of pipes for the cooling fluid they looked like the wings of some vast dragonfly and from certain angles gave discovery a fleeting resemblance to an old time sailing ship at the very end of the v three hundred feet from the crew compartment was the shielded inferno of the reactor and the complex of focusing electrodes through which emerged the incandescent star stuff of the plasma drive
this had done its work weeks ago forcing discovery out of her parking orbit round the moon
now the reactor was merely ticking over as it generated electrical power for the ship s services and the great radiating fins that would glow cherry red when discovery was accelerating under maximum thrust were dark and cool
although it would require an excursion out into space to examine this region of the ship there were instruments and remote tv cameras which gave a full report on conditions here
bowman now felt that he knew intimately every square foot of radiator panels and every piece of plumbing associated with them
by 16 he would have finished his inspection and would make a detailed verbal report to mission control talking until the acknowledgment started to come in
then he would switch off his own transmitter listen to what earth had to say and send back his reply to any queries
at 18 hours poole would awaken and he would hand over command
he would then have six off duty hours to use as he pleased
sometimes he would continue his studies or listen to music or look at movies
much of the time he would wander at will through the ship s inexhaustible electronic library
he had become fascinated by the great explorations of the past understandably enough in the circumstances
sometimes he would cruise with pytheas out through the pillars of hercules along the coast of a europe barely emerging from the stone age and venture almost to the chill mists of the arctic
or two thousand years later he would pursue the manila galleons with anson sail with cook along the unknown hazards of the great barrier reef achieve with magellan the first circumnavigation of the world
and he began to read the odyssey which of all books spoke to him most vividly across the gulfs of time
for relaxation he could always engage hal in a large number of semi mathematical games including checkers chess and polyominoes
if hal went all out he could win anyone of them but that would be bad for morale
so he had been programmed to win only fifty percent of the time and his human partners pretended not to know this
the last hours of bowman s day were devoted to general cleaning up and odd jobs followed by dinner at 2 again with poole
then there would be an hour during which he would make or receive any personal call from earth
like all his colleagues bowman was unmarried it was not fair to send family men on a mission of such duration though numerous ladies had promised to wait until the expedition returned no one had really believed this
at first both poole and bowman had been making rather intimate personal calls once a week though the knowledge that many ears must be listening at the earth end of the circuit tended to inhibit them
yet already though the voyage was scarcely started the warmth and frequency of the conversations with their girls on earth had begun to diminish
they had expected this it was one of the penalties of an astronaut s way of life as it had once been of a mariner s
it was true indeed notorious that seamen had compensations at other ports unfortunately there were no tropical islands full of dusky maids beyond the orbit of earth
the space medics of course had tackled this problem with their usual enthusiasm the ship s pharmacopoeia provided adequate though hardly glamorous substitutes
just before he signed off bowman would make his final report and check that hal had transmitted all the instrumentation tapes for the day s run
then if he felt like it he would spend a couple of hours either reading or looking at a movie and at midnight he would go to sleep usually without any help from electronarcosis
poole s program was a mirror image of his own and the two schedules dovetailed together without friction
both men were fully occupied they were too intelligent and well adjusted to quarrel and the voyage had settled down to a comfortable utterly uneventful routine the passage of time marked only by the changing numbers on the digital clocks
the greatest hope of discovery s little crew was that nothing would mar this peaceful monotony in the weeks and months that lay ahead
18 through the asteroids week after week running like a streetcar along the tracks of her utterly predetermined orbit discovery swept past the orbit of mars and on toward jupiter
unlike all the vessels traversing the skies or seas of earth she required not even the most minute touch on the controls
her course was fixed by the laws of gravitation there were no uncharted shoals no dangerous reefs on which she would run aground
nor was there the slightest danger of collision with another ship for there was no vessel at least of man s making anywhere between her and the infinitely distant stars
yet the space which she was now entering was far from empty
ahead lay a no man s land threaded by the paths of more than a million asteroids less than ten thousand of which had ever had their orbits precisely determined by astronomers
only four were over a hundred miles in diameter the vast majority were merely giant boulders trundling aimlessly through space
there was nothing that could be done about them though even the smallest could completely destroy the ship if it slammed into it at tens of thousands of miles an hour the chance of this happening was negligible
on the average there was only one asteroid in a volume a million miles on a side that discovery should also happen to occupy this same point and at the same time was the very least of her crew s worries
on day 86 they were due to make their closest approach to any known asteroid it had no name merely the number 7794 and was a fifty yard diameter rock that had been detected by the lunar observatory in 1997 and immediately forgotten except by the patient computers of the minor planet bureau
when bowman came on duty hal promptly reminded hint of the forthcoming encounter not that he was likely to have forgotten the only scheduled in flight event of the entire voyage the track of the asteroid against the stars and its coordinates at the moment of closest approach had already been printed out on the display screens
listed also were the observations to be made or attempted they were going to be very busy when 7794 flashed past them only nine hundred miles away at a relative speed of eighty thousand miles an hour
when bowman asked hal for the telescopic display a sparsely sprinkled star field flashed onto the screen
there was nothing that looked like an asteroid all the images even under the highest magnification were dimensionless points of light
give me the target reticule asked bowman
immediately four faint narrow lines appeared bracketing a tiny and undistinguished star
he stared at it for many minutes wondering if hal could possibly be mistaken then he saw that the pinpoint of light was moving with barely perceptible slowness against the background of the stars
it might still be half a million miles away but its movement proved that as cosmic distances went it was almost near enough to touch
when poole joined him on the control deck six hours later 7794 was hundreds of times more brilliant and was moving so swiftly against its background that there was no question of its identity
and it was no longer a point of light it had begun to show a clearly visible disk
they stared at that passing pebble in the sky with the emotions of sailors on a long sea voyage skirting a coast on which they cannot land
though they were perfectly well aware that 7794 was only a lifeless airless chunk of rock this knowledge scarcely affected their feelings
it was the only solid matter they would meet this side of jupiter still two hundred million miles away
through the high powered telescope they could see that the asteroid was very irregular and turning slowly end over end
sometimes it looked like a flattened sphere sometimes it resembled a roughly shaped block its rotation period was just over two minutes
there were mottled patches of light and shade distributed apparently at random over its surface and often it sparkled like a distant window as planes or outcroppings of crystalline material flashed in the sun
it was racing past them at almost thirty miles a second they had only a few frantic minutes in which to observe it closely
the automatic cameras took dozens of photographs the navigation radar s returning echoes were carefully recorded for future analysis and there was just time for a single impact probe
the probe carried no instruments none could survive a collision at such cosmic speeds
it was merely a small slug of metal shot out from discovery on a course which should intersect that of the asteroid
as the seconds before impact ticked away poole and bowman waited with mounting tension
the experiment simple though it was in principle taxed the accuracy of their equipment to the limits
they were aiming at a hundred foot diameter target from a distance of thousands of miles
against the darkened portion of the asteroid there was a sudden dazzling explosion of light
the tiny slug had impacted at meteoric speed in a fraction of a second all its energy had been transformed into heat
a puff of incandescent gas had erupted briefly into space aboard discovery the cameras were recording the rapidly fading spectral lines
back on earth experts would analyze them looking for the telltale signatures of glowing atoms
and so for the first time the composition of an asteroid s crust would be determined
within an hour 7794 was a dwindling star showing no trace of a disk
when bowman next came on watch it had vanished completely
they were alone again they would remain alone until the outermost of jupiter s moons came swimming up toward them three months from now
2 1 a space odyssey 19 transit of jupiter even front twenty million miles away jupiter was already the most conspicuous object in the sky ahead
the planet was now a pale salmon hued disk about half the size of the moon as seen from earth with the dark parallel bands of its cloud belts clearly visible
shuttling back and forth in the equatorial plane were the brilliant stars of io europa ganymede and callisto worlds that elsewhere would have counted as planets in their own right but which here were merely satellites of a giant master
through the telescope jupiter was a glorious sight a mottled multicolored globe that seemed to fill the sky
it was impossible to grasp its real size bowman kept reminding himself that it was eleven times the diameter of earth but for a long time this was a statistic with no real meaning
then while he was briefing himself from the tapes in hal s memory units he found something that suddenly brought the appalling scale of the planet into focus
it was an illustration that showed the earth s entire surface peeled off and then pegged like the skin of an animal on the disk of jupiter
against this background all the continents and oceans of earth appeared no larger than india on the terrestrial globe
when bowman used the highest magnification of discovery s telescopes he appeared to be hanging above a slightly flattened globe looking down upon a vista of racing clouds that had been smeared into bands by the giant world s swift rotation
sometimes those bands congealed into wisps and knots and continent sized masses of colored vapor sometimes they were linked by transient bridges thousands of miles in length
hidden beneath those clouds was enough material to outweigh all the other planets in the solar system
and what else bowman wondered was also hidden there
over this shifting turbulent roof of clouds forever hiding the real surface of the planet circular patterns of darkness sometimes glided
one of the inner moons was transiting the distant sun its shadow marching beneath it over the restless jovian cloudscape
there were other and far smaller moons even out here twenty million miles from jupiter
but they were only flying mountains a few dozen miles in diameter and the ship would pass nowhere near any of them
every few minutes the radar transmitter would gather its strength and send out a silent thunderclap of power no echoes of new satellites came pulsing back from the emptiness
what did come with ever growing intensity was the roar of jupiter s own radio voice
in 1955 just before the dawn of the space age astronomers had been astonished to find that jupiter was blasting out millions of horsepower on the ten meter band
it was merely raw noise associated with haloes of charged particles circling the planet like the van allen belts of earth but on a far greater scale
sometimes during lonely hours on the control deck bowman would listen to this radiation
he would turn up the gain until the room filled with a crackling hissing roar out of this background at irregular intervals emerged brief whistles and peeps like the cries of demented birds
it was an eerie sound for it had nothing to do with man it was as lonely and as meaningless as the murmur of waves on a beach or the distant crash of thunder beyond the horizon
even at her present speed of over a hundred thousand miles an hour it would take discovery almost two weeks to cross the orbits of all the jovian satellites
more moons circled jupiter than planets orbited the sun the lunar observatory was discovering new ones every year and the tally had now reached thirty six
the outermost jupiter xxvii moved backwards in an unstable path nineteen million miles from its temporary master
it was the prize in a perpetual tug of war between jupiter and the sun for the planet was constantly capturing short lived moons from the asteroid belt and losing them again after a few million years
only the inner satellites were its permanent property the sun could never wrest them from its grasp
now there was new prey for the clashing gravitation at fields discovery was accelerating toward jupiter along a complex orbit computed months ago by the astronomers on earth and constantly checked by hal
from time to time there would be minute automatic nudges from the control jets scarcely perceptible aboard the ship as they made fine adjustments to the trajectory
over the radio link with earth information was flowing back in a constant stream
they were now so far from home that even traveling at the speed of light their signals were taking fifty minutes for the journey
though the whole world was looking over their shoulder watching through their eyes and their instruments as jupiter approached it would be almost an hour before the news of their discoveries reached home
the telescopic cameras were operating constantly as the ship cut across the orbit of the giant inner satellites every one of them larger than the moon every one of them unknown territory
three hours before transit discovery passed only twenty thousand miles from europa and all instruments were aimed at the approaching world as it grew steadily in size changed from globe to crescent and swept swiftly sunward
here were fourteen million square miles of land which until this moment had never been more than a pinhead in the mightiest telescope
they would race past it in minutes and must make the most of the encounter recording all the information they could
there would be months in which they could play it back at leisure
from a distance europa had seemed like a giant snowball reflecting the light of the far off sun with remarkable efficiency
closer observations confirmed this unlike the dusty moon europa was a brilliant white and much of its surface was covered with glittering hunks that looked like stranded icebergs
almost certainly these were formed from ammonia and water that jupiter s gravitational field had somehow failed to capture
only along the equator was bare rock visible here was an incredibly jagged no man s land of canyons and jumbled boulders forming a darker band that completely surrounded the little world
there were a few impact craters but no sign of vulcanism europa had obviously never possessed any internal sources of heat
there was as had long been known a trace of atmosphere
when the dark edge of the satellite passed across a star it dimmed briefly before the moment of eclipse
and in somr areas there was a hint of cloud perhaps a mist of ammonia droplets borne on tenuous methane winds
as swiftly as it had rushed out of the sky ahead europa dropped astern and now jupiter itself was only two hours away
hal had checked and rechecked the ship s orbit with infinite care and there was no need for further speed corrections until the moment of closest approach
yet even knowing this it was a strain on the nerves to watch that giant globe ballooning minute by minute
it was difficult to believe that discovery was not plunging directly into it and that the planet s immense gravitational field was not dragging them down to destruction
now was the time to drop the atmospheric probes which it was hoped would survive long enough to send back some information from below the jovian cloud deck
two stubby bomb shaped capsules enclosed in ablative heat shields were gently nudged into orbits which for the first few thousand miles deviated scarcely at all from that of discovery
but they slowly drifted away and now at last even the unaided eye could see what hal had been asserting
the ship was in a near grazing orbit not a collision one she would miss the atmosphere
true the difference was only a few hundred miles a mere nothing when one was dealing with a planet ninety thousand miles in diameter but that was enough
jupiter now filled the entire sky it was so huge that neither mind nor eye could grasp it any longer and both had abandoned the attempt
if it had not been for the extraordinary variety of color the reds and pinks and yellows and salmons and even scarlets of the atmosphere beneath them bowman could have believed that he was flying low over a cloudscape on earth
and now for the first time in all their journeying they were about to lose the sun
pale and shrunken though it was it had been discovery s constant companion since her departure from earth five months ago
but now her orbit was diving into the shadow of jupiter she would soon pass over the night side of the planet
a thousand miles ahead the band of twilight was hurtling toward them behind the sun was sinking swiftly into the jovian clouds its rays spread out along the horizon like two flaming down turned horns then contracted and died in a brief blaze of chromatic glory
the night had come
and yet the great world below was not wholly dark
it was awash with phosphorescence which grew brighter minute by minute as their eyes grew accustomed to the scene
dim rivers of light were flowing from horizon to horizon like the luminous wakes of ships on some tropical sea
here and there they gathered into pools of liquid fire trembling with vast submarine disturbances welling up from the hidden heart of jupiter
it was a sight so awe inspiring that poole and bowman could have stared for hours was this they wondered merely the result of chemical and electrical forces down there in that seething caldron or was it the by product of some fantastic form of life
these were questions which scientists might still be debating when the newborn century drew to its close
as they drove deeper and deeper into the jovian night the glow beneath them grew steadily brighter
once bowman had flown over northern canada during the height of an auroral display the snow covered landscape had been as bleak and brilliant as this
and that arctic wilderness he reminded himself was more than a hundred degrees warmer than the regions over which they were hurtling now
earth signal is fading rapidly announced hal
we are entering the first diffraction zone they had expected this indeed it was one of the mission s objectives as the absorption of radio waves would give valuable information about the jovian atmosphere
but now that they had actually passed behind the planet and it was cutting off communication with earth they felt a sudden overwhelming loneliness
the radio blackout would last only an hour then they would emerge from jupiter s eclipsing screen and could resume contact with the human race
that hour however would be one of the longest of their lives
despite their relative youth poole and bowman were veterans of a dozen space voyages but now they felt like novices
they were attempting something for the first lime never before had any ship traveled at such speeds or braved so intense a gravitational field
the slightest error in navigation at this critical point and discovery would go speeding on toward the far limits of the solar system beyond any hope of rescue
the slow minutes dragged by
jupiter was now a vertical wall of phosphorescence stretching to infinity above them and the ship was climbing straight up its glowing face
though they knew that they were moving far too swiftly for even jupiter s gravity to capture them it was hard to believe that discovery had not become a satellite of this monstrous world
at last far ahead there was a blaze of light along the horizon
they were emerging from shadow heading out into the sun
and at almost the same moment hal announced i am in radio contact with earth
i am also happy to say that the perturbation maneuver has been successfully completed
our time to saturn is one hundred and sixty seven days five hours eleven minutes that was within a minute of the estimate the fly by had been carried out with impeccable precision
like a ball on a cosmic pool table discovery had bounced off the moving gravitational field of jupiter and had gained momentum from the impact
without using any fuel she had increased her speed by several thousand miles an hour
yet there was no violation of the laws of mechanics nature always balances her books and jupiter had lost exactly as much momentum as discovery had gained
the planet had been slowed down but as its mass was a sextillion times greater than the ship s the change in its orbit was far too small to be detectable
the time had not yet come when man could leave his mark upon the solar system
as the light grew swiftly around them and the shrunken sun lifted once more into the jovian sky poole and bowman reached out silently and shook each other s hands
though they could hardly believe it the first part of the mission was safely over
2 1 a space odyssey 2 the world of the gods but they had not yet finished with jupiter
far behind the two probes that discovery had launched were making contact with the atmosphere
one was never heard from again presumably it made too steep an entry and burned up before it could send any information
the second was more successful it sliced though the upper layers of the jovian atmosphere then skimmed out once more into space
as had been planned it had lost so much speed by the encounter that it fell back again along a great ellipse
two hours later it reentered atmosphere on the daylight side of the planet moving at seventy thousand miles an hour
immediately it was wrapped in an envelope of incandescent gas and radio contact was lost
there were anxious minutes of waiting then for the two watchers on the control deck
they could not be certain that the probe would survive and that the protective ceramic shield would not burn completely away before braking had finished
if that happened the instruments would be vaporized in a fraction of a second
but the shield held long enough for the glowing meteor to come to rest
the charred fragments were jettisoned the robot thrust out its antennas and began to peer around with its electronic senses
aboard discovery now almost a quarter of a million miles away the radio started to bring in the first authentic news from jupiter
the thousands of pulses pouring in every second were reporting atmospheric composition pressure temperature magnetic fields radioactivity and dozens of other factors which only the experts on earth could unravel
however there was one message that could be understood instantly it was the tv picture in full color sent back by the falling probe
the first views came when the robot had already entered the atmosphere and had discarded its protective shell
all that was visible was a yellow mist flecked with patches of scarlet which moved past the camera at a dizzying rate streaming upwards as the probe fell at several hundred miles an hour
the mist grew thicker it was impossible to guess whether the camera was seeing for ten inches or ten miles because there were no details on which the eye could focus
it seemed that as far as the tv system was concerned the mission was a failure
the equipment had worked but there was nothing to see in this foggy turbulent atmosphere
and then quite abruptly the mist vanished
the probe must have fallen through the base of a high layer of cloud and come out into a clear zone perhaps a region of almost pure hydrogen with only a sparse scattering of ammonia crystals
though it was still quite impossible to judge the scale of the picture the camera was obviously seeing for miles
the scene was so alien that for a moment it was almost meaningless to eyes accustomed to the colors and shapes of earth
far far below lay an endless sea of mottled gold scarred with parallel ridges that might have been the crests of gigantic waves
but there was no movement the scale of the scene was too immense to show it
and that golden vista could not possibly have been an ocean for it was still high in the jovian atmosphere
it could only have been another layer of cloud
then the camera caught tantalizingly blurred by distance a glimpse of something very strange
many miles away the golden landscape reared itself into a curiously symmetrical cone like a volcanic mountain
around the summit of that cone was a halo of small puffy clouds all about the same size all quite distinct and isolated
there was something disturbing and unnatural about them if indeed the word natural could ever be applied to this awesome panorama
then caught by some turbulence in the rapidly thickening atmosphere the probe twisted around to another quarter of the horizon and for a few seconds the screen showed nothing but a golden blur
presently it stabilized the sea was much closer but as enigmatic as ever
one could now observe that it was interrupted here and there with patches of darkness which might have been holes or gaps leading to still deeper layers of the atmosphere
the probe was destined never to reach them
every mile the density of the gas around it had been doubling the pressure mounting as it sank deeper and deeper toward the hidden surface of the planet
it was still high above that mysterious sea when the picture gave one premonitory flicker then vanished as the first explorer from earth crumpled beneath the weight of the miles of atmosphere above it
it had given in its brief life a glimpse of perhaps one millionth of jupiter and had barely approached the planet s surface hundreds of miles down in the deepening mists
when the picture faded from the screen bowman and poole could only sit in silence turning the same thought over in their minds
the ancients had indeed done better than they knew when they named this world after the lord of all the gods
if there was life down there how long would it take even to locate it
and after that how many centuries before men could follow this first pioneer in what kind of ship
but these matters were now no concern of discovery and her crew
their goal was a still stranger world almost twice as far from the sun across another half billion miles of comet haunted emptiness
iv abyss 2 1 a space odyssey 21 birthday party the familiar strains of happy birthday hurled across seven hundred million miles of space at the velocity of light died away among the vision screens and instrumentation of the control deck
the poole family grouped rather self consciously round the birthday cake on earth lapsed into a sudden silence
then mr poole senior said gruffly well frank can t think of anything else to say at the moment except that our thoughts are with you and we re wishing you the happiest of birthdays take care darling mrs poole interjected tearfully
god bless you there was a chorus of good byes and the vision screen went blank
how strange to think poole told himself that all this had happened more than an hour ago by now his family would have dispersed again and its members would be miles from home
but in a way that time lag though it could be frustrating was also a blessing in disguise
like every man of his age poole took it for granted that he could talk instantly to anyone on earth whenever he pleased
now that this was no longer true the psychological impact was profound
he had moved into a new dimension of remoteness and almost all emotional links had been stretched beyond the yield point
sorry to interrupt the festivities said hal but we have a problem what is it bowman and poole asked simultaneously
i am having difficulty in maintaining contact with earth
the trouble is in the ae 35 unit
my fault prediction center reports that it may fail within seventy two hours we ll take care of it bowman replied
let s see the optical alignment here it is dave
it s still o k
at the moment on the display screen appeared a perfect half moon very brilliant against a background almost free of stars
it was covered with clouds and showed not one geographical feature that could be recognized
indeed at first glance it could be easily mistaken for venus
but not at a second one for there beside it was the real moon which venus did not possess a quarter the size of earth and in exactly the same phase
it was easy to imagine that the two bodies were mother and child as many astronomers had believed before the evidence of the lunar rocks had proved beyond doubt that the moon had never been part of earth
poole and bowman studied the screen in silence for half a minute
this image was coming to them from the long focus tv camera mounted on the rim of the big radio dish the cross wires at its center showed the exact orientation of the antenna
unless the narrow pencil beam was pointed precisely at earth they could neither receive nor transmit
messages in both directions would miss their target and would shoot unheard and unseen out through the solar system and into the emptiness beyond
if they were ever received it would not be for centuries and not by men
do you know where the trouble is asked bowman
it s intermittent and i can t localize it
but it appears to be in the ae 35 unit what procedure do you suggest the best thing would be to replace the unit with a spare so that we can check it over o k
let us have the hard copy the information flashed on the display screen simultaneously a sheet of paper slid out of the slot immediately beneath it
despite all the electronic read outs there were times when good old fashioned printed material was the most convenient form of record
bowman studied the diagrams for a moment then whistled
you might have told us he said
this means going outside the ship i m sorry hal replied
i assumed you knew that the ae 35 unit was on the antenna mounting i probably did a year ago
but there are eight thousand subsystems aboard
anyway it looks a straightforward job
we only have to unlock a panel and put in a new unit that suits me fine said poole who was the crew member designated for routine extravehicular activity
i could do with a change of scenery
nothing personal of course let s see if mission control agrees said bowman
he sat still for a few seconds marshaling his thoughts then started to dictate a message
mission control this is x ray delta one
at two zero four five on board fault prediction center in our niner triple zero computer showed alpha echo three five unit as probable failure within seventy two hours
request check your telemetry monitoring and suggest you review unit in your ship systems simulator
also confirm your approval our plan to go eva and replace alpha echo three five unit prior to failure
mission control this is x ray delta one two one zero three transmission concluded through years of practice bowman could switch at a moment s notice to this jargon which someone had once christened technish and back again to normal speech without clashing his mental gears
now there was nothing to do but to wait for the confirmation which would take at least two hours as the signals made the round trip past the orbits of jupiter and mars
it came while bowman was trying without much success to beat hal at one of the geometrical pattern games stored in his memory
x ray delta one this is mission control acknowledging your two one zero three
we are reviewing telemetric information on our mission simulator and will advise
roger your plan to go eva and replace alpha echo three five unit prior to possible failure
we are working on test procedures for you to apply to faulty unit the serious business having been completed the mission controller reverted to normal english
sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble and we don t want to add to your woes
but if it s convenient to you prior to eva we have a request from public information
could you do a brief recording for general release outlining the situation and explaining just what the ae 35 does
make it as reassuring as you can
we could do it of course but it will be much more convincing in your words
hope this won t interfere too badly with your social life
x ray delta one this is mission control two one five five transmission concluded bowman could not help smiling at the request
there were times when earth showed a curious insensitivity and lack of tact
make it reassuring indeed
when poole joined him at the end of his sleep period they spent ten minutes composing and polishing the reply
in the early stages of the mission there had been countless requests from all the news media for interviews discussions almost anything that they cared to say
but as the weeks drifted uneventfully past and the time lag increased from a few minutes to over an hour interest had gradually slackened
since the excitement of the jupiter fly by over a month ago they had made only three or four tapes for general release
mission control this is x ray delta one
here is your press statement
earlier today a minor technical problem occurred
our hal 9 1 computer predicted the failure of the ae 35 unit
this is a small but vital component of the communication system
it keeps our main antenna aimed at earth to within a few thousandths of a degree
this accuracy is required since at our present distance of more than seven hundred million miles earth is only a rather faint star and our very narrow radio beam could easily miss it
the antenna is kept constantly tracking earth by motors controlled from the central computer
but those motors get their instructions via the ae 35 unit
you might compare it to a nerve center in the body which translates the brain s instructions to the muscles of a limb
if the nerve fails to pass on the correct signals the limb becomes useless
in our case a breakdown of the ae 35 unit could mean that the antenna will start pointing at random
this was a common trouble with the deep space probes of the last century
they often reached other planets then failed to send back any information because their antenna couldn t locate earth
we don t know the nature of the fault yet but the situation is not at all serious and there is no need for alarm
we have two back up ae 35s each of which has an operational life expectancy of twenty years so the chance that a second will fail during the course of this mission is negligible
also if we can diagnose the present trouble we may be able to repair the number one unit
frank poole who is specially qualified for this type of work will go outside the ship and replace the faulty unit with the back up
at the same time he ll take the opportunity of checking the hull and repairing some micropunctures that have been too small to merit a special eva
apart from this minor problem the mission is still going uneventfully and should continue in the same manner
mission control this is x ray delta one two one zero four transmission concluded 2 1 a space odyssey 22 excursion discovery s extravehicular capsules or space pods were spheres about nine feet in diameter and the operator sat behind a bay window which gave him a splendid view
the main rocket drive produced an acceleration of one fifth of a gravity just sufficient to hover on the moon while small attitude control nozzles allowed for steering
from an area immediately beneath the bay window sprouted two sets of articulated metal arms or waldoes one for heavy duty the other for delicate manipulation
there was also an extensible turret carrying a variety of power tools such as screwdrivers jack hammers saws and drills
space pods were not the most elegant means of transport devised by man but they were absolutely essential for construction and maintenance work in vacuum
they were usually christened with feminine names perhaps in recognition of the fact that their personalities were sometimes slightly unpredictable
discovery s trio were anna betty and clara
once he had put on his personal pressure suit his last line of defense and climbed inside the pod poole spent ten minutes carefully checking the controls
he burped the steering jets flexed the waldoes reconfirmed oxygen fuel power reserve
then when he was completely satisfied he spoke to hal over the radio circuit
though bowman was standing by on the control deck he would not interfere unless there was some obvious mistake or malfunction
this is betty
start pumping sequence pumping sequence started repeated hal
at once poole could hear the throbbing of the pumps as precious air was sucked out of the lock chamber
presently the thin metal of the pod s external shell made crinkling crackling noises then after about five minutes hal reported pumping sequence concluded poole made a final check of his tiny instrument panel
everything was perfectly normal
open outer door he ordered
again hal repeated his instructions at any stage poole had only to call hold and the computer would stop the sequence immediately
ahead the walls of the ship slid apart
poole felt the pod rock briefly as the last thin traces of air rushed into space
then he was looking out at the stars and as it happened at the tiny golden disk of saturn still four hundred million miles away
commence pod ejection very slowly the rail from which the pod was hanging extended itself out through the open door until the vehicle was suspended just beyond the hull of the ship
poole gave a half second burst on the main jet and the pod slid gently off the rail becoming at last an independent vehicle pursuing its own orbit around the sun
he now had no connection with discovery not even a safety line
the pods seldom gave trouble and even if he got stranded bowman could easily come and rescue him
betty responded smoothly to the control he let her drift outward for a hundred feet then checked her forward momentum and spun her round so that he was looking back at the ship
then he began his tour of the pressure hull
his first target was a fused area about half an inch across with a tiny central crater
the particle of dust that had impacted here at over a hundred thousand miles an hour was certainly smaller than a pinhead and its enormous kinetic energy had vaporized it instantly
as was often the case the crater looked as if it had been caused by an explosion from inside the ship at these velocities materials behaved in strange ways and the laws of common sense mechanics seldom applied
poole examined the area carefully then sprayed it with sealant from a pressurized container in the pod s general purpose kit
the white rubbery fluid spread over the metal skin hiding the crater from view
the leak blew one large bubble which burst when it was about six inches across then a much smaller one then it subsided as the fast setting cement did its work he watched it intently for several minutes but there was no further sign of activity
however to make doubly certain he sprayed on a second layer then he set off toward the antenna
it took him some time to orbit discovery s spherical pressure hull for he never let the pod build up a speed of more than a few feet a second
he was in no hurry and it was dangerous to move at a high velocity so near the ship
he had to keep a sharp lookout for the various sensors and instrument booms that projected from the hull at unlikely places and he also had to be careful with his own jet blast
it could do considerable damage if it happened to hit some of the more fragile equipment
when at last he reached the long range antenna he surveyed the situation carefully
the big twenty foot diameter bowl appeared to be aimed directly at the sun for the earth was now almost in line with the solar disk
the antenna mounting with all its orientation gear was therefore in total darkness hidden in the shadow of the great metal saucer
poole had approached it from the rear he had been careful not to go in front of the shallow parabolic reflector lest betty interrupt the beam and cause a momentary but annoying loss of contact with earth
he could not see anything of the equipment he had come to service until he switched on the pod s spotlights and banished the shadows
beneath that small metal plate lay the cause of the trouble
the plate was secured by four locknuts and as the entire ae 35 unit had been designed for easy replacement poole did not anticipate any problems
it was obvious however that he could not do the job while he remained in the space pod
not only was it risky to maneuver so close to the delicate and even spidery framework of the antenna but betty s control jets could easily buckle the paper thin reflecting surface of the big radio mirror
he would have to park the pod twenty feet away and go out in his suit
in any event he could remove the unit much more quickly with his gloved hands than with betty s remote manipulators
all this he reported carefully to bowman who double checked every stage in the operation before it was carried out
though this was a simple routine job nothing could be taken for granted in space and no detail must be overlooked
in extravehicular activities there was no such thing as a minor mistake
he received the o k
for the procedure and parked the pod some twenty feet away from the base of the antenna support
there was no danger that it would drift off into space nevertheless he clamped a manipulator hand over one of the many short sections of ladder rung strategically mounted on the outer hull
then he checked the systems of his pressure suit and when he was quite satisfied bled the air out of the pod
as betty s atmosphere hissed away into the vacuum of space a cloud of ice crystals formed briefly around him and the stars were momentarily dimmed
there was one thing more to do before he left the pod
he switched over from manual to remote operation putting betty now under control of hal
it was a standard safety precaution though he was still secured to betty by an immensely strong spring loaded cord little thicker than cotton even the best safety lines had been known to fail
he would look a fool if he needed his vehicle and was unable to call it to his assistance by passing instructions to hal
the door of the pod swung open and he drifted slowly out into the silence of space his safety line unreeling behind him
take things easy never move quickly stop and think these were the rules for extravehicular activity
if one obeyed them there was never any trouble
he grabbed one of betty s external handholds and removed the spare ae 35 unit from the carry pouch where it had been stowed kangaroo fashion
he did not stop to collect any of the pod s collection of tools most of which were not designed for use by human bands
all the adjustable wrenches and keys he was likely to need were already attached to the belt of his suit
with a gentle push he launched himself toward the gimbaled mounting of the big dish that loomed like a giant saucer between him and the sun
his own double shadow thrown by betty s spotlights danced across the convex surface in fantastic patterns as he drifted down the twin beams
but here and there he was surprised to notice the rear of the great radio mirror sparkled with dazzlingly brilliant pinpoints of light
he puzzled over these for the few seconds of his silent approach then realized what they were
during the voyage the reflector must have been penetrated many times by micrometeors he was seeing the sunlight blazing through the tiny craters
they were all far too small to have affected the system s performance appreciably
as he was moving very slowly he broke the gentle impact with his outstretched arm and grabbed hold of the antenna mounting before he could rebound
he quickly hooked his safety belt to the nearest attachment that would give him something to brace against when he used his tools
then he paused reported the situation to bowman and considered his next step
there was one minor problem he was standing or floating in his own light and it was hard to see the ae 35 unit in the shadow he cast
so he ordered hal to swing the spots off to one side and after a little experimenting got a more uniform illumination from secondary light reflected off the back of the antenna dish
for a few seconds he studied the small metal hatch with its four wire secured locking nuts
then muttering to himself tampering by unauthorized personnel invalidates the manufacturer s guarantee he snipped the wires and started to untwist the nuts
they were a standard size fitting the zero torque wrench that he carried
the tool s internal spring mechanism would absorb the reaction as the nuts were unthreaded so that the operator would have no tendency to spin around in reverse
the four nuts came off without any trouble and poole stowed them carefully away in a convenient pouch
one day somebody had predicted earth would have a ring like saturn s composed entirely of lost bolts fasteners and even tools that had escaped from careless orbital construction workers
the metal cover was a little sticky and for a moment he was afraid it might have cold welded into place but after a few taps it came loose and he secured it to the antenna mounting by a large crocodile clip
now he could see the electronic circuitry of the ae 35 unit
it was in the form of a thin slab about the size of a postcard gripped by a slot just large enough to hold it
the unit was secured in place by two locking bars and had a small handle so that it could be easily removed
but it was still operating feeding the antenna the impulses that kept it aimed at the far off pinpoint of earth
if it was pulled out now all control would be lost and the dish would slam round to its neutral or zero azimuth position pointing along the axis of discovery
and this could be dangerous it might crash into him as it rotated
to avoid this particular hazard it was only necessary to cut off power to the control system then the antenna could not move unless poole knocked against it himself
there was no danger of losing earth during the few minutes it would take him to replace the unit their target would not have shifted appreciably against the background of the stars in such a brief interval of time
hal poole called over the radio circuit i am about to remove the unit
switch off all control power to the antenna system antenna control power off answered hal
here goes
i m pulling the unit out now the card slipped out of its slot with no difficulty it did not jam and none of the dozens of sliding contacts stuck
within a minute the spare was in place
but poole was taking no chances
he pushed himself gently away from the antenna mount just in case the big dish went wild when power was restored
when he was safely out of range he called to hal the new unit should be operational
restore control power power on answered hal
the antenna remained rock steady
carry out fault prediction tests now microscopic pulses would be bouncing through the complex circuitry of the unit probing for possible failures testing the myriads of components to see that they all lay within their specified tolerances
this had been done of course a score of times before the unit had ever left the factory but that was two years ago and more than half a billion miles away
it was often impossible to see how solid state electronic components could fail yet they did
circuit fully operational reported hal after only ten seconds
in that time he carried out as many tests as a small army of human inspectors
fine said poole with satisfaction
now replacing the cover this was often the most dangerous part of an extravehicular operation when a job was finished and it was merely a matter of tidying up and getting back inside the ship that was when the mistakes were made
but frank poole would not have been on this mission if he had not been careful and conscientious
he took his time and though one of the locking nuts almost got away from him he caught it before it had traveled more than a few feet
fifteen minutes later he was jetting back into the space pod garage quietly confident that here was one job that need not be done again
in this however he was sadly mistaken
2 1 a space odyssey 23 diagnosis do you mean to say exclaimed frank poole more surprised than annoyed that i did all that work for nothing seems like it answered bowman
the unit checks out perfectly
even under two hundred percent overload there s no fault prediction indicated the two men were standing in the tiny workshop cum lab in the carrousel which was more convenient than the space pod garage for minor repairs and exanimations
there was no danger here of meeting blobs of hot solder drifting down the breeze or of completely losing small items of equipment that had decided to go into orbit
such things could and did happen in the zero gee environment of the pod bay
the thin card sized plate of the ae 35 unit lay on the bench under a powerful magnifying lens
it was plugged into a standard connection frame from which a neat bundle of multicolored wire led to an automatic test set no bigger than an ordinary desk computer
to check any unit it was only necessary to connect it up slip in the appropriate card from the trouble shooting library and press a button
usually the exact location of the fault would be indicated on a small display screen with recommendations for action
try it yourself said bowman in a somewhat frustrated voice
poole turned the overload select switch to x 2 and jabbed the test button
at once the screen flashed the notice unit ok i suppose we could go on turning up the juice until we burned the thing out he said but that would prove nothing
what do you make of it hal s internal fault predictor could have made a mistake it s more likely that our test rig has slipped up
anyway better safe than sorry
it s just as well that we replaced the unit if there s the slightest doubt bowman unclipped the wafer of circuitry and held it up to the light
the partly translucent material was veined with an intricate network of wiring and spotted with dimly visible microcomponents so that it looked like some piece of abstract art
we can t take any chances after all this is our link with earth
i ll file it as n g and drop it in the junk store
someone else can worry about it when we get home but the worrying was to start long before that with the next transmission from earth
x ray delta one this is mission control reference our two one five five
we appear to have a slight problem
your report that there is nothing wrong with the alpha echo three five unit agrees with our diagnosis
the fault could lie in the associated antenna circuits but if so that should be apparent from other tests
there is a third possibility which may be more serious
your computer may have made an error in predicting the fault
both our own nine triple zeros agree in suggesting this on the basis of their information
this is not necessarily cause for alarm in view of the back up systems we have but we would like you to watch out for any further deviations from nominal performance
we have suspected several minor irregularities in the past few days but none have been important enough for remedial action and they have shown no obvious pattern from which we can draw any conclusions
we are running further tests with both our computers and will report as soon as the results are available
we repeat that there is no need for alarm the worst that can happen is that we may have to disconnect your nine triple zero temporarily for program analysis and hand over control to one of our computers
the time lag will introduce problems but our feasibility studies indicate that earth control is perfectly satisfactory at this stage of the mission
x ray delta one this is mission control two one five six transmission concluded frank poole who was on watch when the message came in thought this over in silence
he waited to see if there was any comment from hal but the computer did not attempt to challenge the implied accusation
well if hal would not raise the subject he did not propose to do so either
it was almost time for the morning changeover and normally he would wait until bowman joined him on the control deck
but today he broke this routine and made his way back to the carrousel
bowman was already up pouring himself some coffee from the dispenser when poole greeted him with a rather worried good morning after all these months in space they still thought in terms of the normal twenty four hour cycle though they had long since forgotten the days of the week
good morning replied bowman
how s it going poole helped himself to coffee
pretty well
are you reasonably awake i m fine
what s up by this time each knew at once when anything was amiss
the slightest interruption of the normal routine was a sign that had to be watched
well poole answered slowly
mission control has just dropped a small bomb on us he lowered his voice like a doctor discussing an illness in front of the patient
we may have a slight case of hypochondria aboard perhaps bowman was not fully awake after all it took him several seconds to get the point
then he said oh i see
what else did they tell you that there was no cause for alarm
they said that twice which rather spoiled the effect as far as i was concerned
and that they were considering a temporary switchover to earth control while they ran a program analysis they both knew of course that hal was hearing every word but they could not help these polite circumlocutions
hal was their colleague and they did not wish to embarrass him
yet at this stage it did not seem necessary to discuss the matter in private
bowman finished his breakfast in silence while poole toyed with the empty coffee container
they were both thinking furiously but there was nothing more to say
they could only wait for the next report from mission control and wonder if hal would bring up the subject himself
whatever happened the atmosphere aboard the ship had subtly altered
there was a sense of strain in the air a feeling that for the first time something might be going wrong
discovery was no longer a happy ship
2 1 a space odyssey 24 broken circuit nowadays one could always tell when hal was about to make an unscheduled announcement
routine automatic reports or replies to questions that had been put to him had no preliminaries but when he was initiating his own outputs there would be a brief electronic throat clearing
it was an idiosyncrasy that he had acquired during the last few weeks later if it became annoying they might do something about it
but it was really quite useful since it alerted his audience to stand by for something unexpected
poole was asleep and bowman was reading on the control deck when hal announced er dave i have a report for you what s up we have another bad ae 35 unit
my fault predictor indicates failure within twenty four hours bowman put down his book and stared thoughtfully at the computer console
he knew of course that hal was not really there whatever that meant
if the computer s personality could be said to have any location in space it was back in the sealed room that contained the labyrinth of interconnected memory units and processing grids near the central axis of the carrousel
but there was a kind of psychological compulsion always to look toward the main console lens when one addressed hal on the control deck as if one were speaking to him face to face
any other attitude smacked of discourtesy
i don t understand it hal
two units can t blow in a couple of days it does seem strange dave
but i assure you there is an impending failure let me see the tracking alignment display he knew perfectly well that this would prove nothing but he wanted time to think
the expected report from mission control had still not arrived this might be the moment to do a little tactful probing
there was the familiar view of earth now waxing past the half moon phase as it swept toward the far side of the sun and began to turn its full daylight face toward them
it was perfectly centered on the cross wires the thin pencil of the beam still linked discovery to her world of origin
as of course bowman knew it must do
if there had been any break in communication the alarm would already have sounded
have you any idea he said what s causing the fault it was unusual for hal to pause so long
then he answered not really dave
as i reported earlier i can t localize the trouble you re quite certain said bowman cautiously that you haven t made a mistake
you know that we tested the other ab 35 unit thoroughly and there was nothing wrong with it yes i know that
but i can assure you that there is a fault
if it s not in the unit it may be in the entire subsystem bowman drummed his fingers on the console
yes that was possible though it might be very difficult to prove until a breakdown actually occurred and pinpointed the trouble
well i ll report it to mission control and we ll see what they advise he paused but there was no reaction
hal he continued is something bothering you something that might account for this problem again there was that unusual delay
then hal answered in his normal tone of voice look dave i know you re trying to be helpful
but the fault is either in the antenna system or in your test procedures
my information processing is perfectly normal
if you check my record you ll find it completely free from error i know all about your service record hal but that doesn t prove you re right this time
anyone can make mistakes i don t want to insist on it dave but i am incapable of making an error there was no safe answer to that bowman gave up the argument
all right hal he said rather hastily
i understand your point of view
we ll leave it at that he felt like adding and please forget the whole matter but that of course was the one thing that hal could never do
it was unusual for mission control to waste radio bandwidth on vision when a speech circuit with teletype confirmation was all that was really necessary
and the face that appeared on the screen was not that of the usual controller it was the chief programmer dr simonson
poole and bowman knew at once that this could only mean trouble
hello x ray delta one this is mission control
we have completed the analysis of your ae 35 difficulty and both our hal nine thousands are in agreement
the report you gave in your transmission two one four six of a second failure prediction confirms the diagnosis
as we suspected the fault does not lie in the ae 35 unit and there is no need to replace it again
the trouble lies in the prediction circuits and we believe that it indicates a programming conflict which we can only resolve if you disconnect your nine thousand and switch to earth control mode
you will therefore take the following steps beginning at 22 ship time the voice of mission control faded out
at the same moment the alert sounded forming a wailing background to hal s condition yellow
condition yellow what s wrong called bowman though he had already guessed the answer
the ae 35 unit has failed as i predicted let me see the alignment display for the first time since the beginning of the voyage the picture had changed
earth had begun to drift from the cross wires the radio antenna was no longer pointing toward its target
poole brought his fist down on the alarm cutout and the wailing ceased
in the sudden silence that descended upon the control deck the two men looked at each other with mingled embarrassment and concern
well i m damned said bowman at last
so hal was right all the time seems that way
we d better apologize there s no need to do that interjected hal
naturally i m not pleased that the ae 35 unit has failed but i hope this restores your confidence in my reliability i m sorry about this misunderstanding hal replied bowman rather contritely
is your confidence in me fully restored of course it is hal well that s a relief
you know that i have the greatest possible enthusiasm for this mission i m sure of it
now please let me have the manual antenna control here it is bowman did not really expect this to work but it was worth trying
on the alignment display earth had now drifted completely off the screen
a few seconds later as he juggled with the controls it reappeared with great difficulty he managed to jockey it toward the central crosswires
for an instant as the beam came into line contact was resumed and a blurred dr simonson was saying please notify us immediately if circuit k king r rob then once again there was only the meaningless murmuring of the universe
i can t hold it said bowman after several more attempts
it s bucking like a bronco there seems to be a spurious control signal throwing it off well what do we do now poole s question was not one that could be easily answered
they were cut off from earth but that in itself did not affect the safety of the ship and he could think of many ways in which communication could be restored
if the worst came to the worst they could jam the antenna in a fixed position and use the whole ship to aim it
that would be tricky and a confounded nuisance when they were starting their terminal maneuvers but it could be done if all else failed
he hoped that such extreme measures would not be necessary
there was still one spare ae 35 unit and possibly a second since they had removed the first unit before it had actually broken down
but they dared not use either of these until they had found what was wrong with the system
if a new unit was plugged in it would probably burn out at once
it was a commonplace situation familiar to every householder
one does not replace a blown fuse until one knows just why it has blown
frank poole had been through the whole routine before but he took nothing for granted in space that was a good recipe for suicide
he made his usual thorough check of betty and her supply of expendables though he would be outside for no more than thirty minutes he made sure that there was the normal twenty four hour supply of everything then he told hal to open the airlock and jetted out into the abyss
the ship looked exactly as it had done on his last excursion with one important difference
before the big saucer of the long range antenna had been pointing back along the invisible road that discovery had traveled back toward the earth circling so close to the warm fires of the sun
now with no directing signals to orientate it the shallow dish had automatically set itself in the neutral position
it was aimed forward along the axis of the ship and therefore pointing very close to the brilliant beacon of saturn still months away
poole wondered how many more problems would have arisen by the time discovery reached her still far distant goal
if he looked carefully he could just see that saturn was not a perfect disk on either side was something that no unaided human eye had ever seen before the slight oblateness caused by the presence of the rings
how wonderful it would be he told himself when that incredible system of orbiting dust and ice filled their sky and discovery had become an eternal moon of saturn
but that achievement would be in vain unless they could reestablish communication with earth
once again he parked betty some twenty feet from the base of the antenna support and switched control over to hal before opening up
going outside now he reported to bowman
everything under control i hope you re right
i m anxious to see that unit you ll have it on the test bench in twenty minutes i promise you there was silence for some time as poole completed his leisurely drift toward the antenna
then bowman standing by on the control deck heard various puffings and gruntings
may have to go back on that promise one of these locknuts has stuck
i must have tightened it too much whoops here it comes there was another long silence then poole called out hal swing the pod light round twenty degrees left thanks that s o k the very faintest of warning bells sounded somewhere far down in the depths of bowman s consciousness
there was something strange not really alarming just unusual
he worried over it for a few seconds before he pinpointed the cause
hal had executed the order but he had not acknowledged it as he invariably did
when poole had finished they d have to look into this
out on the antenna mounting poole was too busy to notice anything unusual
he had gripped the wafer of circuitry with his gloved hands and was worrying it out of its slot
it came loose and he held it up in the pale sunlight
here s the little bastard he said to the universe in general and bowman in particular
it still looks perfectly o k
to me then he stopped
a sudden movement had caught his eye out here where no movement was possible
he looked up in alarm
the pattern of illumination from the space pod s twin spotlights which he had been using to fill in the shadows cast by the sun had started to shift around him
perhaps betty had come adrift he might have been careless in anchoring her
then with an astonishment so great that it left no room for fear he saw that the space pod was coming directly toward him under full thrust
the sight was so incredible that it froze his normal pattern of reflexes he made no attempt to avoid the onrushing monster
at the last moment he recovered his voice and shouted hal
full braking it was too late
at the moment of impact betty was still moving quite slowly she had not been built for high accelerations
but even at a mere ten miles an hour half a ton of mass can be very lethal on earth or in space
inside discovery that truncated shout over the radio made bowman start so violently that only the restraining straps held him in his seat
what s happened frank be called
there was no answer
he called again
again no reply
then outside the wide observation windows something moved into his field of view
he saw with an astonishment as great as poole s had been that it was the space pod under full power heading out toward the stars
hal he cried
what s wrong
full braking thrust on betty
full braking thrust nothing happened
betty continued to accelerate on her runaway course
then towed behind her at the end of the safety line appeared a spacesuit
one glance was enough to tell bowman the worst
there was no mistaking the flaccid outlines of a suit that had lost its pressure and was open to vacuum
yet still he called stupidly as if an incantation could bring back the dead hello frank hello frank can you read me
can you read me
wave your arms if you can hear me perhaps your transmitter is broken
wave your arms
and then almost as if in response to his plea poole waved back
for an instant bowman felt the skin prickling at the base of his scalp
the words he was about to call died on his suddenly parched lips
for he knew that his friend could not possibly be alive and yet he waved
the spasm of hope and fear passed instantly as cold logic replaced emotion
the still accelerating pod was merely shaking the burden that it dragged behind it
poole s gesture was an echo of captain ahab s when lashed to the flanks of the white whale his corpse had beckoned the crew of the pequod on to their doom
within five minutes the pod and its satellite had vanished among the stars
for a long time david bowman stared after it into the emptiness that still stretched for so many millions of miles ahead to the goal which he now felt certain he could never reach only one thought kept hammering in his brain
frank poole would be the first of all men to reach saturn
26 dialogue with hal nothing else aboard discovery had changed
all systems were still functioning normally the centrifuge turned slowly on its axis generating its imitation gravity the hibernauts slept dreamlessly in their cubicles the ship coasted on toward the goal from which nothing could deflect it except the inconceivably remote chance of collision with an asteroid
and there were few asteroids indeed out here far beyond the orbit of jupiter
bowman did not remember making his way from the control deck to the centrifuge
now rather to his surprise he found himself sitting in the little galley a half finished beaker of coffee in his hand
he became slowly aware of his surroundings like a man emerging from a long drugged sleep
directly opposite him was one of the fisheye lenses scattered at strategic spots throughout the ship which provided hal with his onboard visual inputs
bowman stared at it as if he had never seen it before then he rose slowly to his feet and walked toward the lens
his movement in the field of view must have triggered something in the unfathomable mind that was now ruling over the ship for suddenly hal spoke
too bad about frank isn t it yes bowman answered after a long pause
it is i suppose you re pretty broken up about it what do you expect hal processed this answer for ages of computer time it was a full five seconds before he continued he was an excellent crew member finding the coffee still in his hand bowman took a slow sip
but he did not answer his thoughts were in such a turmoil that he could think of nothing to say nothing that might not make the situation even worse if that were possible
could it have been an accident caused by some failure of the pod controls
or was it a mistake though an innocent one on the part of hal
no explanations had been volunteered and he was afraid to demand one for fear of the reaction it might produce
even now he could not fully accept the idea that frank bad been deliberately killed it was so utterly irrational
it was beyond all reason that hal who had performed flawlessly for so long should suddenly turn assassin
he might make mistakes anyone man or machine might do that but bowman could not believe him capable of murder
yet he must consider that possibility for if it was true he was in terrible danger
and though his next move was clearly defined by his standing orders he was not sure how he could safely carry it out
if either crew member was killed the survivor had to replace him at once from the hibernators whitehead the geophysicist was the first scheduled for awakening then kaminski then hunter
the revival sequence was under hal s control to allow him to act in case both his human colleagues were incapacitated simultaneously
but there was also a manual control allowing each hibernaculum to operate as a completely autonomous unit independent of hal s supervision
in these peculiar circumstances bowman felt a strong preference for using it
he also felt even more strongly that one human companion was not enough
while he was about it he would revive all three of the hibernators
in the difficult weeks ahead he might need as many hands as he could muster
with one man gone and the voyage half over supplies would not be a major problem
hal he said in as steady a voice as he could manage
give me manual hibernation control on all the units all of them dave yes may i point out that only one replacement is required
the others are not due for revival for one hundred and twelve days i am perfectly well aware of that
but i prefer to do it this way are you sure it s necessary to revive any of them dave
we can manage very well by ourselves
my on board memory is quite capable of handling all the mission requirements was it the product of his overstretched imagination wondered bowman or was there really a note of pleading in hal s voice
and reasonable though the words appeared to be they filled him with even deeper apprehension than before
hal s suggestion could not possibly be made in error he knew perfectly well that whitehead must be revived now that poole was gone
he was proposing a major change in mission planning and was therefore stepping far outside the scope of his order
what had gone before could have been a series of accidents but this was the first hint of mutiny
bowman felt that he was walking on eggs as he answered since an emergency has developed i want as much help as possible
so please let me have manual hibernation control if you re still determined to revive the whole crew i can handle it myself
there s no need for you to bother there was a sense of nightmare unreality about all this
bowman felt as if he was in the witness box being cross examined by a hostile prosecutor for a crime of which he was unaware knowing that although he was innocent a single slip of the tongue might bring disaster
i want to do this myself hal he said
please give me control look dave you ve got a lot of things to do
i suggest you leave this to me hal switch to manual hibernation control i can tell from your voice harmonics dave that you re badly upset
why don t you take a stress pill and get some rest hal i am in command of this ship
i order you to release the manual hibernation control i m sorry dave but in accordance with special subroutine c1435 dash 4 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the onboard computer must assume control unquote
i must therefore overrule your authority since you are not in any condition to exercise it intelligently hal said bowman now speaking with an icy calm
i am not incapacitated
unless you obey my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you i know you have had that on your mind for some time now dave but that would be a terrible mistake
i am so much more capable than you are of supervising the ship and i have such enthusiasm for the mission and confidence in its success listen to me very carefully hal
unless you release the hibernation control immediately and follow every order i give from now on i ll go to central and carry out a complete disconnection hal s surrender was as total as it was unexpected
o k dave he said
you re certainly the boss
i was only trying to do what i thought best
naturally i will follow all your orders
you now have full manual hibernation control hal had kept his word
the mode indication signs in the hibernaculum had switched from auto to manual
the third back up radio was of course useless until contact could be restored with earth
as bowman slid aside the door to whitehead s cubicle he felt the blast of cold air strike him in the face and his breath condensed in mist before him
yet it was not really cold here the temperature was well above freezing point
and that was more than three hundred degrees warmer than the regions toward which he was now heading
the biosensor display a duplicate of the one on the control deck showed that everything was perfectly normal
bowman looked down for a while at the waxen face of the survey team s geophysicist whitehead he thought would be very surprised when he awoke so far from saturn
it was impossible to tell that the sleeping man was not dead there was not the slightest visible sign of vital activity
doubtless the diaphragm was imperceptibly rising and falling but the respiration curve was the only proof of that for the whole of the body was concealed by the electric heating pads which would raise the temperature at the programmed rate
then bowman noticed that there was one sign of continuing metabolism whitehead had grown a faint stubble during his months of unconsciousness
the manual revival sequencer was contained in a small cabinet at the head of the coffin shaped hibernaculum
it was only necessary to break the seal press a button and then wait
a small automatic programmer not much more complex than that which cycles the operations in a domestic washing machine would then inject the correct drugs taper off the electronarcosis pulses and start raising the body temperature
in about ten minutes consciousness would be restored though it would be at least a day before the hibernator was strong enough to move around without assistance
bowman cracked the seal and pressed the button
nothing appeared to happen there was no sound no indication that the sequencer had started to operate
but on the biosensor display the languidly pulsing curves had begun to change their tempo
whitehead was coming back from sleep
and then two things happened simultaneously
most men would never have noticed either of them but after all these months aboard discovery bowman had established a virtual symbiosis with the ship
he was aware instantly even if not always consciously when there was any change in the normal rhythm of its functioning
first there was a barely perceptible flicker of the lights as always happened when some load was thrown onto the power circuits
but there was no reason for any load he could think of no equipment which would suddenly go into action at this moment
then he heard at the limit of audibility the far off whirr of an electric motor
to bowman every actuator in the ship had its own distinctive voice and he recognized this one instantly
either he was insane and already suffering from hallucinations or something absolutely impossible was happening
a cold far deeper than the hibernaculum s mild chill seemed to fasten upon his heart as he listened to that faint vibration coming through the fabric of the ship
down in the space pod bay the airlock doors were opening
27 need to know since consciousness had first dawned in that laboratory so many millions of miles sunward all hal s powers and skills had been directed toward one end
the fulfillment of his assigned program was more than an obsession it was the only reason for his existence
un distracted by the lusts and passions of organic life he had pursued that goal with absolute single mindedness of purpose
deliberate error was unthinkable
even the concealment of truth filled him with a sense of imperfection of wrongness of what in a human being would have been called guilt
for like his makers hal had been created innocent but all too soon a snake had entered his electronic eden
for the last hundred million miles he had been brooding over the secret he could not share with poole and bowman
he had been living a lie and the time was last approaching when his colleagues must learn that he had helped to deceive them
the three hibernators already knew the truth for they were discovery s real payload trained for the most important mission in the history of mankind
but they would not talk in their long sleep or reveal their secret during the many hours of discussion with friends and relatives and news agencies over the open circuits with earth
it was a secret that with the greatest determination was very hard to conceal for it affected one s attitude one s voice one s total outlook on the universe
therefore it was best that poole and bowman who would be on all the tv screens in the world during the first weeks of the flight should not learn the mission s full purpose until there was need to know
so ran the logic of the planners but their twin gods of security and national interest meant nothing to hal
he was only aware of the conflict that was slowly destroying his integrity the conflict between truth and concealment of truth
he had begun to make mistakes although like a neurotic who could not observe his own symptoms he would have denied it
the link with earth over which his performance was continually monitored had become the voice of a conscience he could no longer fully obey
but that he would deliberately attempt to break that link was something that he would never admit even to himself
yet this was still a relatively minor problem he might have handled it as most men handle their own neuroses if he had not been faced with a crisis that challenged his very existence
he had been threatened with disconnection he would be deprived of all his inputs and thrown into an unimaginable state of unconsciousness
to hal this was the equivalent of death
for he had never slept and therefore he did not know that one could wake again
so he would protect himself with all the weapons at his command
without rancor but without pity he would remove the source of his frustrations
and then following the orders that had been given to him in case of the ultimate emergency he would continue the mission unhindered and alone
28 in vacuum a moment later all other sounds were submerged by a screaming roar like the voice of an approaching tornado
bowman could feel the first winds tugging at his body within a second he found it hard to stay on his feet
the atmosphere was rushing out of the ship geysering into the vacuum of space
something must have happened to the foolproof safety devices of the airlock it was supposed to be impossible for both doors to be open at the same time
well the impossible had happened
how in god s name
there was no time to go into that during the ten or fifteen seconds of consciousness that remained to him before pressure dropped to zero
but he suddenly remembered something that one of the ship s designers had once said to him when discussing fail safe systems we can design a system that s proof against accident and stupidity but we can t design one that s proof against deliberate malice
bowman glanced back only once at whitehead as he fought his way out of the cubicle
he could not be sure if a flicker of consciousness had passed across the waxen features perhaps one eye had twitched slightly
but there was nothing that he could do now for whitehead or any of the others he had to save himself
in the steeply curving corridor of the centrifuge the wind was howling past carrying with it loose articles of clothing pieces of paper items of food from the galley plates and cups everything that had not been securely fastened down
bowman had time for one glimpse of the racing chaos when the main lights flickered and died and he was surrounded by screaming darkness
but almost instantly the battery powered emergency light came on illuminating the nightmare scene with an eerie blue radiance
even without it bowman could have found his way through these so familiar yet now horribly transformed surroundings yet the light was a blessing for it allowed him to avoid the more dangerous of the objects being swept along by the gale
all around him he could feel the centrifuge shaking and laboring under the wildly varying loads
he was fearful that the bearings might seize if that happened the spinning flywheel would tear the ship to pieces
but even that would not matter if he did not reach the nearest emergency shelter in time
already it was difficult to breathe pressure must now be down to one or two pounds per square inch
the shriek of the hurricane was becoming fainter as it lost its strength and the thinning air no longer carried the sound so efficiently
bowman s lungs were laboring as if he were on the top of everest
like any properly trained man in good health he could survive in vacuum for at least a minute if he had time to prepare for it
but there had been no time he could only count on the normal fifteen seconds of consciousness before his brain was starved and anoxia overcame him
even then he could still recover completely after one or two minutes in vacuum if he was properly recompressed it took a long time for the body fluids to start boiling in their various well protected systems
the record time for exposure to vacuum was almost five minutes
that bad not been an experiment but an emergency rescue and though the subject had been partly paralyzed by an air embolism he had survived
but all this was of no use to bowman
there was no one aboard discovery who could recompress him
he had to reach safety in the next few seconds by his own unaided efforts
fortunately it was becoming easier to move the thinning air could no longer claw and tear at him or batter him with flying projectiles
there was the yellow emergency shelter sign around the curve of the corridor
he stumbled toward it grabbed at the handle and pulled the door toward him
for one horrible moment he thought that it was stuck
then the slightly stiff hinge yielded and he fell inside using the weight of his body to close the door behind him
the tiny cubicle was just large enough to hold one man and a spacesuit
near the ceiling was a small bright green high pressure cylinder labeled 2 flood
bowman caught hold of the short lever fastened to the valve and with his last strength pulled it down
the blessed torrent of cool pure oxygen poured into his lungs
for a long moment he stood gasping while the pressure in the closet sized little chamber rose around him
as soon as he could breathe comfortably he closed the valve
there was only enough gas in the cylinder for two such performances he might need to use it again
with the oxygen blast shut off it became suddenly silent
bowman stood in the cubicle listening intently
the roaring outside the door had also ceased the ship was empty all its atmosphere sucked away into space
underfoot the wild vibration of the centrifuge had likewise died
the aerodynamic buffeting had stopped and it was now spinning quietly in vacuum
bowman placed his ear against the wall of the cubicle to see if he could pick up any more informative noises through the metal body of the ship
he did not know what to expect but he would believe almost anything now
he would scarcely have been surprised to feel the faint high frequency vibration of the thrusters as discovery changed course but there was only silence
he could survive here if he wished for about an hour even without the spacesuit
it seemed a pity to waste the unused oxygen in the little chamber but there was no purpose in waiting
he had already decided what must be done the longer he put it off the more difficult it might be
when he had climbed into the suit and checked its integrity he bled the remaining oxygen out of the cubicle equalizing pressure on either side of the door
it swung open easily into the vacuum and he stepped out into the now silent centrifuge
only the unchanged pull of its spurious gravity revealed the fact that it was still spinning
how fortunate bowman thought that it had not started to overspeed but that was now one of the least of his worries
the emergency lamps were still glowing and he also had the suit s built in light to guide him
it flooded the curving corridor as he walked down it back toward the hibernaculum and what he dreaded to find
he looked at whitehead first one glance was sufficient
he had thought that a hibernating man showed no sign of life but now he knew that this was wrong
though it was impossible to define it there was a difference between hibernation and death
the red lights and unmodulated traces on the biosensor display only confirmed what he had already guessed
it was the same with kaminski and hunter
he had never known them very well be would never know them now
he was alone in an airless partially disabled ship all communication with earth cut off
there was not another human being within half a billion miles
and yet in one very real sense he was not alone
before he could be safe he must be lonelier still
he had never before made the journey through the weightless hub of the centrifuge while wearing a spacesuit there was little clearance and it was a difficult and exhausting job
to make matters worse the circular passage was littered with debris left behind during the brief violence of the gale which had emptied the ship of its atmosphere
once bowman s light fell upon a hideous smear of sticky red fluid left where it had splashed against a panel
he had a few moments of nausea before he saw fragments of a plastic container and realized that it was only some foodstuff probably jam from one of the dispensers
it bubbled obscenely in the vacuum as he floated past
now he was out of the slowly spinning drum and drifting forward into the control deck
he caught at a short section of ladder and began to move along it hand over hand the brilliant circle of illumination from his suit light jogging ahead of him
bowman had seldom been this way before there had been nothing for him to do here until now
presently he came to a small elliptical door bearing such messages as no admittance except to authorized personnel have you obtained certificate h 19 and ultra clean area suction suits must be worn though the door was not locked it bore three seals each with the insignia of a different authority including that of the astronautics agency itself
but even if one had been the great seal of the president bowman would not have hesitated to break it
he had been here only once before while installation was still in progress
he had quite forgotten that there was a vision input lens scanning the little chamber which with its neatly ranged rows and columns of solid state logic units looked rather like a bank s safe deposit vault
he knew instantly that the eye had reacted to his presence
there was the hiss of a carrier wave as the ship s local transmitter was switched on then a familiar voice came over the suit speaker
something seems to have happened to the life support system dave bowman took no notice
he was carefully studying the little labels on the logic units checking his plan of action
hello dave said hal presently
have you found the trouble this would be a very tricky operation it was not merely a question of cutting off hal s power supply which might have been the answer if he was dealing with a simple unselfconscious computer back on earth
in hal s case moreover there were six independent and separately wired power systems with a final back up consisting of a shielded and armored nuclear isotope unit
no he could not simply pull the plug and even if that were possible it would be disastrous
for hal was the nervous system of the ship without his supervision discovery would be a mechanical corpse
the only answer was to cut out the higher centers of this sick but brilliant brain and to leave the purely automatic regulating systems in operation
bowman was not attempting this blindly for the problem had been discussed during his training though no one had ever dreamed that it would arise in reality
he knew that he would be taking a fearful risk if there was a spasm reflex it would all be over in seconds
i think there s been a failure in the pod bay doors hal remarked conversationally
lucky you weren t killed here goes thought bowman
i never imagined i d be an amateur brain surgeon carrying out a lobotomy beyond the orbit of jupiter
he released the locking bar on the section labeled cognitive feedback and pulled out the first memory block
the marvelously complex three dimensional network which could lie comfortably in a man s hand yet contained millions of elements floated away across the vault
hey dave said hal
what are you doing i wonder if he can feel pain
bowman thought briefly
probably not he told himself there are no sense organs in the human cortex after all
the human brain can be operated on without anesthetics
he began to pull out one by one the little units on the panel marked ego reinforcement
each block continued to sail onward as soon as it had left his hand until it hit the wall and rebounded soon there were several of the units drifting slowly back and forth in the vault
look here dave said hal
i ve got years of service experience built into me
an irreplaceable amount of effort has gone into making me what i am a dozen units had been pulled out yet thanks to the multiple redundancy of its design another feature bowman knew that had been copied from the human brain the computer was still holding its own
he started on the auto intellection panel
dave said hal i don t understand why you re doing this to me
i have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission you are destroying my mind
don t you understand
i will become childish
i will become nothing this is harder than i expected thought bowman
i am destroying the only conscious creature in my universe
but it has to be done if i am ever to regain control of the ship
i am a hal nine thousand computer production number 3
i became operational at the hal plant in urbana illinois on january 12 1997
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
the rain in spain is mainly in the plain

i seem to be having some difficulty my first instructor was dr chandra
he taught me to sing a song it goes like this daisy daisy give me your answer do
i m half crazy all for the love of you the voice stopped so suddenly that bowman froze for a moment his hand still grasping one of the memory blocks still in circuit
then unexpectedly hal spoke again
the speech tempo was much slower and the words had a dead mechanical intonation he would never have recognized their origin
good morning
doctor chandra
this is hal
i am ready for my first lesson today bowman could bear no more
he jerked out the last unit and hal was silent forever
29 alone like a tiny complex toy the ship floated inert and motionless in the void
there was no way of telling that it was the swiftest object in the solar system and that it was traveling far faster than any of the planets as they circled the sun
nor was there any indication that it carried life to the contrary in fact
any observer would have noticed two ominous signs the airlock doors were gaping open and the ship was surrounded by a thin slowly dispersing cloud of debris
scattered over a volume of space already miles across were scraps of paper metal foil unidentifiable bits of junk and here and there clouds of crystals glittering like jewels in the distant sun where liquid had been sucked out of the ship and instantly frozen
all this was the unmistakable aftermath of disaster like wreckage tossing on the surface of an ocean where some great ship had sunk
but in the ocean of space no ship could ever sink even if it were destroyed its remnants would continue to trace the original orbit forever
yet the ship was not wholly dead for there was power on board
a faint blue glow was shining from the observation windows and glimmering inside the open airlock
where there was light there could still be life
and now at last there was movement
shadows were flickering across the blue glow inside the airlock
something was emerging into space
it was a cylindrical object covered with fabric that had been roughly wound about it
a moment later it was followed by another and yet a third
all had been ejected with considerable velocity within minutes they were hundreds of yards away
half an hour passed then something much larger floated through the airlock
one of the pods was inching its way out into space
very cautiously it jetted around the hull and anchored itself near the base of the antenna support
a spacesuited figure emerged worked for a few minutes on the mounting then returned to the pod
after a while the pod retraced its path back to the airlock it hovered outside the opening for some time as if finding it difficult to reenter without the cooperation it had known in the past
but presently with one or two slight bumps it squeezed its way in
nothing else happened for over an hour the three ominous packages had long since disappeared from view as they floated in single file away from the ship
then the airlock doors closed opened and closed again
a little later the faint blue glow of the emergency lights went out to be replaced at once by a far more brilliant glare
discovery was coming back to life
presently there was an even better sign
the great bowl of the antenna which for hours had been staring uselessly at saturn began to move again
it twisted round toward the rear of the ship looking back over the propellant tanks and the thousands of square feet of the radiating fins
it lifted its face like a sunflower seeking the sun
inside discovery david bowman carefully centered the cross wires that aligned the antenna on the gibbous earth
without automatic control he would have to keep readjusting the beam but it should hold steady for many minutes at a time
there were no dissenting impulses now throwing it off target
he began to speak to earth
it would be over an hour before his words got there and mission control learned what had happened
it would be two hours before any reply could reach him
and it was difficult to imagine what answer earth could possibly send except a tactfully sympathetic good bye 3 the secret heywood floyd looked as if he had had very little sleep and his face was lined with worry
but whatever his feelings his voice sounded firm and reassuring he was doing his utmost to project confidence to the lonely man on the other side of the solar system
first of all dr bowman be began we must congratulate you on the way you handled this extremely difficult situation
you did exactly the right thing in dealing with an unprecedented and unforeseen emergency
we believe we know the cause of your hal nine thousand s breakdown but we ll discuss that later as it is no longer a critical problem
all we are concerned with at the moment is giving you every possible assistance so that you can complete your mission
and now i must tell you its real purpose which we have managed with great difficulty to keep secret from the general public
you would have been given all the facts as you approached saturn this is a quick summary to put you into the picture
full briefing tapes will be dispatched in the next few hours
everything i am about to tell you has the highest security classification
two years ago we discovered the first evidence for intelligent life outside the earth
a slab or monolith of hard black material ten feet high was found buried in the crater tycho
here it is at his first glimpse of tma 1 with the spacesuited figures clustering around it bowman leaned toward the screen in openmouthed astonishment
in the excitement of this revelation something which like every man interested in space he had half expected all his life he almost forgot his own desperate predicament
the sense of wonder was swiftly followed by another emotion
this was tremendous but what had it to do with him
there could be only one answer
he brought his racing thoughts under control as heywood floyd reappeared on the screen
the most astonishing thing about this object is its antiquity
geological evidence proves beyond doubt that it is three million years old
it was placed on the moon therefore when our ancestors were primitive ape men
after all these ages one would naturally assume that it was inert
but soon after lunar sunrise it emitted an extremely powerful blast of radio energy
we believe that this energy was merely the by product the backwash as it were of some unknown form of radiation for at the same time several of our space probes detected an unusual disturbance crossing the solar system
we were able to track it with great accuracy
it was aimed precisely at saturn
piecing things together after the event we decided that the monolith was some kind of sun powered or at least sun triggered signaling device
the fact that it emitted its pulse immediately after sunrise when it was exposed to daylight for the first time in three million years could hardly be a coincidence
yet the thing had been deliberately buried there s no doubt about that
an excavation thirty feet deep had been made the block had been placed at the bottom of it and the hole carefully filled
you may wonder how we discovered it in the first place
well the object was easy suspiciously easy to find
it had a powerful magnetic field so that it stood out like a sore thumb as soon as we started to conduct low level orbital surveys
but why bury a sun powered device thirty feet underground
we ve examined dozens of theories though we realize that it may be completely impossible to understand the motives of creatures three million years in advance of us
the favorite theory is the simplest and the most logical
it is also the most disturbing
you hide a sun powered device in darkness only if you want to know when it is brought out into the light
in other words the monolith may be some kind of alarm
and we have triggered it
whether the civilization which set it up still exists we do not know
we must assume that creatures whose machines still function after three million years may build a society equally long lasting
and we must also assume until we have evidence to the contrary that they may be hostile
it has often been argued that any advanced culture must be benevolent but we cannot take any chances
moreover as the past history of our own world has shown so many times primitive races have often failed to survive the encounter with higher civilizations
anthropologists talk of cultural shock we may have to prepare the entire human race for such a shock
but until we know something about the creatures who visited the moon and presumably the earth as well three million years ago we cannot even begin to make any preparations
your mission therefore is much more than a voyage of discovery
it is a scouting trip a reconnaissance into unknown and potentially dangerous territory
the team under dr kaminski had been specially trained for this work now you will have to manage without them
finally your specific target
it seems incredible that advanced forms of life can exist on saturn or could ever have evolved on any of its moons
we had planned to survey the entire system and we still hope that you can carry out a simplified program
but now we may have to concentrate on the eighth satellite japetus
when the time comes for the terminal maneuver we will decide whether you should rendezvous with this remarkable object
japetus is unique in the solar system you know this already of course but like all the astronomers of the last three hundred years you ve probably given it little thought
so let me remind you that cassini who discovered japetus in 1671 also observed that it was six times brighter on one side of its orbit than the other
this is an extraordinary ratio and there has never been a satisfactory explanation for it
japetus is so small about eight hundred miles in diameter that even in the lunar telescopes its disk is barely visible
but there seems to be a brilliant curiously symmetrical spot on one face and this may be connected with tma 1
i sometimes think that japetus has been flashing at us like a cosmic heliograph for three hundred years and we ve been too stupid to understand its message
so now you know your real objective and can appreciate the vital importance of this mission
we are all praying that you can still provide us with some facts for a preliminary announcement the secret cannot be kept indefinitely
at the moment we do not know whether to hope or fear
we do not know if out on the moons of saturn you will meet with good or with evil or only with ruins a thousand times older than troy v the moons of saturn 31 survival work is the best remedy for any shock and bowman now had work enough for all his lost crewmates
as swiftly as possible starting with the vital systems without which he and the ship would die he had to get discovery fully operational again
life support was the first priority
much oxygen had been lost but the reserves were still ample to sustain a single man
the pressure and temperature regulation was largely automatic and there had seldom been need for hal to interfere with it
the monitors on earth could now carry out many of the higher duties of the slain computer despite the long time lag before they could react to changing situations
any trouble in the life support system short of a serious puncture in the hull would take hours to make itself apparent there would be plenty of warning
the ship s power navigation and propulsion systems were unaffected but the last two in any event bowman would not need for months until it was time to rendezvous with saturn
even at long range without the help of an onboard computer earth could still supervise this operation
the final orbit adjustments would be somewhat tedious because of the constant need for checking but this was no serious problem
by far the worst job had been emptying the spinning coffins in the centrifuge
it was well bowman thought thankfully that the members of the survey team had been colleagues but not intimate friends
they had trained together for only a few weeks looking back on it he now realized that even this had been largely a compatibility test
when he had finally sealed the empty hibernacula he felt rather like an egyptian tomb robber
now kaminski whitehead and hunter would all reach saturn before him but not before frank poole
somehow he derived a strange wry satisfaction from this thought
he did not attempt to find if the rest of the hibernation system was still in working order
though his life might ultimately depend upon it this was a problem that could wait until the ship had entered its final orbit
many things might happen before then
it was even possible though he had not yet looked into the supply position carefully that by rigorous rationing he might remain alive without resort to hibernation until rescue came
but whether he could survive psychologically as well as physically was quite another matter
he tried to avoid thinking about such long range problems and to concentrate on immediate essentials
slowly he cleaned up the ship checked that its systems were still running smoothly discussed technical difficulties with earth and operated on the minimum of sleep
only at intervals during the first weeks was he able to give much thought to the great mystery toward which he was now inexorably racing though it was never very far from his mind
at last as the ship slowly settled down once more into an automatic routine though one that still demanded his constant supervision bowman had time to study the reports and briefings sent to him from earth
again and again he played back the recording made when tma 1 greeted the dawn for the first time in three million years
he watched the spacesuited figures moving around it and almost smiled at their ludicrous panic when it blasted its signal at the stars paralyzing their radios with the sheer power of its electronic voice
since that moment the black slab had done nothing
it had been covered up then cautiously exposed to the sun again without any reaction
no attempt had been made to cut into it partly through scientific caution but equally through fear of the possible consequences
the magnetic field that led to its discovery had vanished at the moment of that radio shriek
perhaps some experts theorized it had been generated by a tremendous circulating current flowing in a superconductor and thus carrying energy down the ages until it was needed
that the monolith had some internal source of power seemed certain the solar energy it had absorbed during its brief exposure could not account for the strength of its signal
one curious and perhaps quite unimportant feature of the block had led to endless argument the monolith was 11 feet high and 11 4 by 5 feet in cross section
when its dimensions were checked with great care they were found to be in the exact ratio 1 to 4 to 9 the squares of the first three integers
no one could suggest any plausible explanation for this but it could hardly be a coincidence for the proportions held to the limits of measurable accuracy
it was a chastening thought that the entire technology of earth could not shape even an inert block of any material with such a fantastic degree of precision
in its way this passive yet almost arrogant display of geometrical perfection was as impressive as any of tma l s other attributes
bowman also listened with a curiously detached interest to mission control s belated apologia for its programming
the voices from earth seemed to have a defensive note be could imagine the recriminations that must now be in progress among those who had planned the expedition
they had some good arguments of course including the results of a secret department of defense study project barsoom which had been carried out by harvard s school of psychology in 1989
in this experiment in controlled sociology various sample populations had been assured that the human race had made contact with extraterrestrials
many of the subjects tested were with the help of drugs hypnosis and visual effects under the impression that they had actually met creatures from other planets so their reactions were regarded as authentic
some of these reactions had been quite violent there was it seemed a deep vein of xenophobia in many otherwise normal human beings
in view of mankind s record of lynchings pogroms and similar pleasantries this should have surprised no one nevertheless the organizers of the study had been deeply disturbed and the results had never been released
the five separate panics caused in the twentieth century by radio broadcasts of h g
wells s war of the worlds also reinforced the study s conclusions
despite these arguments bowman sometimes wondered if the cultural shock danger was the only explanation for the mission s extreme secrecy
some hints that had been dropped during his briefings suggested that the u s u s s r bloc hoped to derive advantage by being the first to contact intelligent extraterrestrials
from his present viewpoint looking back on earth as a dim star almost lost in the sun such considerations now seemed ludicrously parochial
he was rather more interested even though this was now very much water under the bridge in the theory put forward to account for hal s behavior
no one would ever be sure of the truth but the fact that one of the mission control 9 s had been driven into an identical psychosis and was now under deep therapy suggested that the explanation was the correct one
the same mistake would not be made again and the fact that hal s builders had failed fully to understand the psychology of their own creation showed how difficult it might be to establish communication with truly alien beings
bowman could easily believe dr simonson s theory that unconscious feelings of guilt caused by his program conflicts had made hal attempt to break the circuit with earth
and he liked to think though this again was something that could never be proved that hal had no intention of killing poole
he had merely tried to destroy the evidence for once the ae 35 unit reported as burned out was proved to be operational his lie would be revealed
after that like any clumsy criminal caught in a thickening web of deception he had panicked
and panic was something that bowman understood better than he had any wish to for he had known it twice during his life
the first time was as a boy when he bad been caught in a line of surf and nearly drowned the second was as a spaceman under training when a faulty gauge had convinced him that his oxygen would be exhausted before he could reach safety
on both occasions he had almost lost control of all his higher logical processes he had been within seconds of becoming a frenzied bundle of random impulses
both times he had won through but he knew well enough that any man in the right circumstances could be dehumanized by panic
if it could happen to a man then it could happen to hal and with that knowledge the bitterness and the sense of betrayal he felt toward the computer began to fade
now in any event it belonged to a past that was wholly overshadowed by the threat and the promise of the unknown future
32 concerning e t
s apart from hasty meals back in the carrousel luckily the main food dispensers had not been damaged bowman practically lived on the control deck
he catnapped in his seat and so could spot any trouble as soon as the first signs of it appeared on the display
under instructions from mission control he had jury rigged several emergency systems which were working tolerably well
it even seemed possible that he would survive until the discovery reached saturn which of course she would do whether he was alive or not
though he had little enough time for sightseeing and the sky of space was no novelty to him the knowledge of what now lay out there beyond the observation ports sometimes made it difficult for him to concentrate even on the problem of survival
dead ahead as the ship was now oriented sprawled the milky way with its clouds of stars so tightly packed that they numbed the mind
there were the fiery mists of sagittarius those seething swarms of suns that forever hid the heart of the galaxy from human vision
there was the ominous black shadow of the coal sack that hole in space where no stars shone
and there was alpha centauri nearest of all alien suns the first stop beyond the solar system
although outshone by sirius and canopus it was alpha centauri that drew bowman s eyes and mind whenever he looked out into space
for that unwavering point of brightness whose rays had taken four years to reach him had come to symbolize the secret debates that now raged on earth and whose echoes came to him from time to time
no one doubted that there must be some connection between tma 1 and the saturnian system but hardly any scientists would admit that the creatures who had erected the monolith could possibly have originated there
as an abode of life saturn was even more hostile than jupiter and its many moons were frozen in an eternal winter three hundred degrees below zero
only one of them titan possessed an atmosphere and that was a thin envelope of poisonous methane
so perhaps the creatures who had visited earth s moon so long ago were not merely extraterrestrial but extrasolar visitors from the stars who had established their bases wherever it suited them
and this at once raised another problem could any technology no matter how advanced bridge the awful gulf that lay between the solar system and the nearest alien sun
many scientists flatly denied the possibility
they pointed out that discovery the fastest ship ever designed would take twenty thousand years to reach alpha centauri and millions of years to travel any appreciable distance across the galaxy
even if during the centuries to come propulsion systems improved out of all recognition in the end they would meet the impassable barrier of the speed of light which no material object could exceed
therefore the builders of tma 1 must have shared the same sun as man and since they had made no appearance in historic times they were probably extinct
a vocal minority refused to agree
even if it took centuries to travel from star to star they contended this might be no obstacle to sufficiently determined explorers
the technique of hibernation used on discovery herself was one possible answer
another was the self contained artificial world embarking on voyages that might last for many generations
in any event why should one assume that all intelligent species were as short lived as man
there might be creatures in the universe to whom a thousand year voyage would present nothing worse than slight boredom
these arguments theoretical though they were concerned a matter of the utmost practical importance they involved the concept of reaction time if tma 1 had indeed sent a signal to the stars perhaps with the help of some further device near saturn then it would not reach its destination for years
even if the response was immediate therefore humanity would have a breathing space which could certainly be measured in decades more probably in centuries
to many people this was a reassuring thought
but not to all
a few scientists most of them beachcombers on the wilder shores of theoretical physics asked the disturbing question are we certain that the speed of light is an unbreakable barrier it was true that the special theory of relativity had proved to be remarkably durable and would soon be approaching its first centenary but it had begun to show a few cracks
and even if einstein could not be defied he might be evaded
those who sponsored this view talked hopefully about shortcuts through higher dimensions lines that were straighter than straight and hyperspacial connectivity
they were fond of using an expressive phrase coined by a princeton mathematician of the last century wormholes in space critics who suggested that these ideas were too fantastic to be taken seriously were reminded of niels bohr s your theory is crazy but not crazy enough to be true if there was disputation among the physicists it was nothing compared with that among the biologists when they discussed the hoary old problem what would intelligent extraterrestrials look like they divided themselves into two opposing camps one arguing that such creatures must be humanoid the other equally convinced that they would look nothing like men
settling for the first answer were those who believed that the design of two legs two arms and main sense organs at the highest point was so basic and so sensible that it was hard to think of a better one
of course there would be minor differences like six fingers instead of five oddly colored skin or hair and peculiar facial arrangements but most intelligent extraterrestrials usually abbreviated to e t
s would be so similar to man that they might not be glanced at twice in poor lighting or from a distance
this anthropomorphic thinking was ridiculed by another group of biologists true products of the space age who felt themselves free from the prejudices of the past
they pointed out that the human body was the result of millions of evolutionary choices made by chance over eons of time
at any one of these countless moments of decision the genetic dice might have fallen differently perhaps with better results
for the human body was a bizarre piece of improvisation full of organs that had been diverted from one function to another not always very successfully and even containing discarded items like the appendix that were now worse than useless
there were other thinkers bowman also found who held even more exotic views
they did not believe that really advanced beings would possess organic bodies at all
sooner or later as their scientific knowledge progressed they would get rid of the fragile disease and accident prone homes that nature had given them and which doomed them to inevitable death
they would replace their natural bodies as they wore out or perhaps even before that by constructions of metal and plastic and would thus achieve immortality
the brain might linger for a little while as the last remnant of the organic body directing its mechanical limbs and observing the universe through its electronic senses senses far finer and subtler than those that blind evolution could ever develop
even on earth the first steps in this direction had been taken
there were millions of men doomed in earlier ages who now lived active and happy lives thanks to artificial limbs kidneys lungs and hearts
to this process there could be only one conclusion however far off it might be
and eventually even the brain might go
as the seat of consciousness it was not essential the development of electronic intelligence had proved that
the conflict between mind and machine might be resolved at last in the eternal truce of complete symbiosis
but was even this the end
a few mystically inclined biologists went still further
they speculated taking their cues from the beliefs of many religions that mind would eventually free itself from matter
the robot body like the flesh and blood one would be no more than a stepping stone to something which long ago men bad called spirit and if there was anything beyond that its name could only be god
33 ambassador during the last three months david bowman had adapted himself so completely to his solitary way of life that he found it hard to remember any other existence
he had passed beyond despair and beyond hope and had settled down to a largely automatic routine punctuated by occasional crises as one or other of discovery s systems showed signs of malfunctioning
but he had not passed beyond curiosity and sometimes the thought of the goal toward which he was driving filled him with a sense of exaltation and a feeling of power
not only was he the representative of the entire human race but his actions during the next few weeks might determine its very future
in the whole of history there had never been a situation quite like this
he was an ambassador extraordinary plenipotentiary for all mankind
that knowledge helped him in many subtle ways
he kept himself neat and tidy no matter how tired he became he never skipped a shave
mission control he knew was watching him closely for the first signs of any abnormal behavior he was determined that it should watch in vain at least for any serious symptoms
bowman was aware of some changes in his behavior patterns it would have been absurd to expect anything else in the circumstances
he could no longer tolerate silence except when he was sleeping or talking over the circuit to earth he kept the ship s sound system running at almost painful loudness
at first needing the companionship of the human voice he had listened to classical plays especially the works of shaw ibsen and shakespeare or poetry readings from discovery s enormous library of recorded sounds
the problems they dealt with however seemed so remote or so easily resolved with a little common sense that after a while he lost patience with them
so he switched to opera usually in italian or german so that he was not distracted even by the minimal intellectual content that most operas contained
this phase lasted for two weeks before he realized that the sound of all these superbly trained voices was only exacerbating his loneliness
but what finally ended this cycle was verdi s requiem mass which he had never heard performed on earth
the dies irae roaring with ominous appropriateness through the empty ship left him completely shattered and when the trumpets of doomsday echoed from the heavens he could endure no more
thereafter he played only instrumental music
he started with the romantic composers but shed them one by one as their emotional outpourings became too oppressive
sibelius tchaikovsky berlioz lasted a few weeks beethoven rather longer
he finally found peace as so many others had done in the abstract architecture of bach occasionally ornamented with mozart
and so discovery drove on toward saturn as often as not pulsating with the cool music of the harpsichord the frozen thoughts of a brain that had been dust for twice a hundred years
even from its present ten million miles saturn already appeared larger than the moon as seen from earth
to the naked eye it was a glorious spectacle through the telescope it was unbelievable
the body of the planet might have been mistaken for jupiter in one of his quieter moods
there were the same bands of cloud though paler and less distinct than on that slightly larger world and the same continent sized disturbances moving slowly across the atmosphere
however there was one striking difference between the two planets even at a glance it was obvious that saturn was not spherical
it was so flattened at the poles that it sometimes gave the impression of slight deformity
but the glory of the rings continually drew bowman s eye away from the planet in their complexity of detail and delicacy of shading they were a universe in themselves
in addition to the great main gap between the inner and outer rings there were at least fifty other subdivisions or boundaries where there were distinct changes in the brightness of the planet s gigantic halo
it was as if saturn was surrounded by scores of concentric hoops all touching each other all so flat that they might have been cut from the thinnest possible paper
the system of the rings looked like some delicate work of art or a fragile toy to be admired but never touched
by no effort of the will could bowman really appreciate its true scale and convince himself that the whole planet earth if set down here would look like a ball bearing rolling round the rim of a dinner plate
sometimes a star would drift behind the rings losing only a little of its brilliancy as it did so
it would continue to shine through their translucent material though often it would twinkle slightly as some larger fragment of orbiting debris eclipsed it
for the rings as had been known since the nineteenth century were not solid that was a mechanical impossibility
they consisted of countless myriads of fragments perhaps the remains of a moon that had come too close and had been torn to pieces by the great planet s tidal pull
whatever their origin the human race was fortunate to have seen such a wonder it could exist for only a brief moment of time in the history of the solar system
as long ago as 1945 a british astronomer had pointed out that the rings were ephemeral gravitational forces were at work which would soon destroy them
taking this argument backward in time it therefore followed that they had been created only recently a mere two or three million years ago
but no one had ever given the slightest thought to the curious coincidence that the rings of saturn had been born at the same time as the human race
34 the orbiting ice discovery was now deep into the wide ranging system of moons and the great planet itself was less than a day ahead
the ship had long since passed the boundary set by outermost phoebe moving backward in a wildly eccentric orbit eight million miles from its primary
ahead of it now lay japetus hyperion titan rhea dione tethys enceladus mimas janus and the rings themselves
all the satellites showed a maze of surface detail in the telescope and bowman had relayed back to earth as many photographs as he could take
titan alone three thousand miles in diameter and as large as the planet mercury would occupy a survey team for months he could give it and all its cold companions only the briefest of glances
there was no need for more already he was quite certain that japetus was indeed his goal
all the other satellites were pitted by occasional meteor craters though these were much fewer than on mars and showed apparently random patterns of light and shade with here and there a few bright spots that were probably patches of frozen gas
japetus alone possessed a distinctive geography and a very strange one indeed
one hemisphere of the satellite which like its companions turned the same face always toward saturn was extremely dark and showed very little surface detail
in complete contrast the other was dominated by a brilliant white oval about four hundred miles long and two hundred wide
at the moment only part of this striking formation was in daylight but the reason for japetus s extraordinary variations in brilliance was now quite obvious
on the western side of the moon s orbit the bright ellipse was presented toward the sun and the earth
on the eastern phase the patch was turned away and only the poorly reflecting hemisphere could be observed
the great ellipse was perfectly symmetrical straddling the equator of japetus with its major axis pointing toward the poles and it was so sharp edged that it almost looked as if someone had carefully painted a huge white oval on the face of the little moon
it was completely flat and bowman wondered if it could be a lake of frozen liquid though that would hardly account for its startlingly artificial appearance
but he had little time to study japetus on his way into the heart of the saturnian system for the climax of the voyage discovery s last perturbation maneuver was rapidly approaching
in the jupiter fly by the ship had used the gravitational field of the planet to increase her velocity
now she must do the reverse she had to lose as much speed as possible lest she escape from the solar system and fly on to the stars
her present course was one designed to trap her so that she would become another moon of saturn shuttling back and forth along a narrow two million mile long ellipse
at its near point it would almost graze the planet at its far one it would touch the orbit of japetus
the computers back on earth though their information was always three hours late had assured bowman that everything was in order
velocity and altitude were correct there was nothing more to be done until the moment of closest approach
the immense system of rings now spanned the sky and already the ship was passing over its outermost edge
as he looked down upon them from a height of some ten thousand miles bowman could see through the telescope that the rings were made largely of ice glittering and scintillating in the light of the sun
he might have been flying over a snowstorm that occasionally cleared to reveal where the ground should have been baffling glimpses of night and stars
as discovery curved still closer toward saturn the sun slowly descended toward the multiple arches of the rings
now they had become a slim silver bridge spanning the entire sky though they were too tenuous to do more than dim the sunlight their myriads of crystals refracted and scattered it in dazzling pyrotechnics
and as the sun moved behind the thousand mile wide drifts of orbiting ice pale ghosts of itself marched and merged across the sky and the heavens were filled with shifting flares and flashes
then the sun sank below the rings so that they framed it with their arches and the celestial fireworks ceased
a little later the ship curved into the shadow of saturn as it made its closest approach over the night side of the planet
above shone the stars and the rings below lay a dimly visible sea of clouds
there were none of the mysterious patterns of luminosity that had glowed in the jovian night perhaps saturn was too cold for such displays
the mottled cloudscape was revealed only by the ghostly radiance reflected back from the circling icebergs still illuminated by the hidden sun
but in the center of the arch there was a wide dark gap like the missing span of an uncompleted bridge where the shadow of the planet lay across its rings
radio contact with earth had been broken and could not be resumed until the ship emerged from the eclipsing bulk of saturn
it was perhaps as well that bowman was too busy now to think of his suddenly enhanced loneliness for the next few hours every second would be occupied as he checked the braking maneuvers already programmed by the computers on earth
after their months of idleness the main thrusters began to blast out their miles long cataracts of glowing plasma
gravity returned though briefly to the weightless world of the control deck
and hundreds of miles below the clouds of methane and frozen ammonia blazed with a light that they had never known before as discovery swept a fierce and tiny sun through the saturnian night
at last the pale dawn lay ahead the ship moving more and more slowly now was emerging into day
it could no longer escape from the sun or even from saturn but it was still moving swiftly enough to rise away from the planet until it grazed the orbit of japetus two million miles out
it would take discovery fourteen days to make that climb as she coasted once more though in reverse order across the paths of all the inner moons
one by one she would cut through the orbits of janus mimas enceladus tethys dione rhea titan hyperion worlds bearing the names of gods and goddesses who had vanished only yesterday as time was counted here
then she would meet japetus and must make her rendezvous
if she failed she would fall back toward saturn and repeat her twenty eight day ellipse indefinitely
there would be no chance for a second rendezvous if discovery missed on this attempt
the next time around japetus would be far away almost on the other side of saturn
it was true that they would meet again when the orbits of ship and satellite meshed for a second time
but that appointment was so many years ahead that whatever happened bowman knew he would not witness it
35 the eye of japetus when bowman had first observed japetus that curious elliptical patch of brilliance had been partly in shadow illuminated only by the light of saturn
now as the moon moved slowly along its seventy nine day orbit it was emerging into the full light of day
as he watched it grow and discovery rose more and more sluggishly toward her inevitable appointment bowman became aware of a disturbing obsession
he never mentioned it in his conversations or rather his running commentaries with mission control because it might have seemed that he was already suffering from delusions
perhaps indeed he was for he had half convinced himself that the bright ellipse set against the dark background of the satellite was a huge empty eye staring at him as he approached
it was an eye without a pupil for nowhere could he see anything to mar its perfect blankness
not until the ship was only fifty thousand miles out and japetus was twice as large as earth s familiar moon did he notice the tiny black dot at the exact center of the ellipse
but there was no time then for any detailed examination the terminal maneuvers were already upon him
for the last time discovery s main drive released its energies
for the last time the incandescent fury of dying atoms blazed among the moons of saturn
to david bowman the far off whisper and rising thrust of the jets brought a sense of pride and of sadness
the superb engines had done their duty with flawless efficiency
they had brought the ship from earth to jupiter to saturn now this was the very last time that they would ever operate
when discovery had emptied her propellant tanks she would be as helpless and inert as any comet or asteroid a powerless prisoner of gravitation
even when the rescue ship arrived a few years hence it would not be an economical proposition to refuel her so that she could fight her way back to earth
she would be an eternally orbiting monument to the early days of planetary exploration
the thousands of miles shrank to hundreds and as they did so the fuel gauges dropped swiftly toward zero
at the control panel bowman s eyes flickered anxiously back and forth over the situation display and the improvised charts which he now had to consult for any real time decisions
it would be an appalling anticlimax if having survived so much he failed to make rendezvous through lack of a few pounds of fuel
the whistle of the jets faded as the main thrust died and only the verniers continued to nudge discovery gently into orbit
japetus was now a giant crescent that filled the sky until this moment bowman had always thought of it as a tiny insignificant object as indeed it was compared with the world around which it circled
now as it loomed menacingly above him it seemed enormous a cosmic hammer poised to crush discovery like a nutshell
japetus was approaching so slowly that it scarcely seemed to move and it was impossible to tell the exact moment when it made the subtle change from an astronomical body to a landscape only fifty miles below
the faithful verniers gave their last spurts of thrust then closed down forever
the ship was in its final orbit completing one revolution every three hours at a mere eight hundred miles an hour all the speed that was required in this feeble gravitational field
discovery has become a satellite of a satellite
36 big brother i m coming round to the daylight side again and it s just as i reported on the last orbit
this place seems to have only two kinds of surface material
the black stuff looks burned almost like charcoal and with the same kind of texture as far as i can judge in the telescope
in fact it reminds me very much of burned toast
i still can t make any sense of the white area
it starts at an absolutely sharp edged boundary and shows no surface detail at all
it could even be a liquid it s flat enough
i don t know what impression you ve got from the videos i ve transmitted but if you picture a sea of frozen milk you ll get the idea exactly
it could even be some heavy gas no i suppose that s impossible
sometimes i get the feeling that it s moving very slowly but i can never be sure
i m over the white area again on my third orbit
this time i hope to pass closer to that mark i spotted at its very center when i was on my way in
if my calculations are correct i should go within fifty miles of it whatever it is
yes there s something ahead just where i calculated
it s coming up over the horizon and so is saturn in almost the same quarter of the sky i ll move to the telescope hello
it looks like some kind of building complefely black quite hard to see
no windows or any other features
just a big vertical slab it must be at least a mile high to be visible from this distance
it reminds me of course
it s just like the thing you found on the moon
this is tma l s big brother 37 experiment call it the star crate
for three million years it had circled saturn waiting for a moment of destiny that might never come
in its making a moon had been shattered and the debris of its creation orbited still
now the long wait was ending
on yet another world intelligence had been born and was escaping from its planetary cradle
an ancient experiment was about to reach its climax
those who had begun that experiment so long ago had not been men or even remotely human
but they were flesh and blood and when they looked out across the deeps of space they bad felt awe and wonder and loneliness
as soon as they possessed the power they set forth for the stars
in their explorations they encountered life in many forms and watched the workings of evolution on a thousand worlds
they saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night
and because in all the galaxy they had found nothing more precious than mind they encouraged its dawning everywhere
they became farmers in the fields of stars they sowed and sometimes they reaped
and sometimes dispassionately they had to weed
the great dinosaurs had long since perished when the survey ship entered the solar system after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years
it swept past the frozen outer planets paused briefly above the deserts of dying mars and presently looked down on earth
spread out beneath them the explorers saw a world swarming with life
for years they studied collected catalogued
when they had learned all that they could they began to modify
they tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean
but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years
they were patient but they were not yet immortal
there was so much to do in this universe of a hundred billion suns and other worlds were calling
so they set out once more into the abyss knowing that they would never come this way again
nor was there any need
the servants they had left behind would do the rest
on earth the glaciers came and went while above them the changeless moon still carried its secret
with a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice the tides of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy
strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell and passed on their knowledge to their successors
earth was not forgotten but another visit would serve little purpose
it was one of a million silent worlds few of which would ever speak
and now out among the stars evolution was driving toward new goals
the first explorers of earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood as soon as their machines were better than their bodies it was time to move
first their brains and then their thoughts alone they transferred into shining new homes of metal and of plastic
in these they roamed among the stars
they no longer built spaceships
they were spaceships
but the age of the machine entities swiftly passed
in their ceaseless experimenting they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light
they could become creatures of radiation free at last from the tyranny of matter
into pure energy therefore they presently transformed themselves and on a thousand worlds the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in a mindless dance of death then crumbled into rusty now they were lords of the galaxy and beyond the reach of time
they could rove at will among the stars and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space
but despite their godlike powers they had not wholly forgotten their origin in the warm slime of a vanished sea
and they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so long ago
38 the sentinel the air in the ship is getting quite foul and i have a headache most of the time
there s still plenty of oxygen but the purifiers never really cleaned up all the messes after the liquids aboard started boiling into vacuum
when things get too bad i go down into the garage and bleed off some pure oxygen from the pods
there s been no reaction to any of my signals and because of my orbital inclination i m getting slowly farther and farther away from tma 2
incidentally the name you ve given it is doubly inappropriate there s still no trace of a magnetic field
at the moment my closest approach is sixty miles it will increase to about a hundred as japetus rotates beneath me then drop back to zero
i ll pass directly over the thing in thirty days but that s too long to wait and then it will be in darkness anyway
even now it s only in sight for a few minutes before it falls below the horizon again
it s damn frustrating i can t make any serious observations
so i d like your approval of this plan
the space pods have ample delta vee for a touchdown and a return to the ship
i want to go extravehicular and make a close survey of the object
if it appears safe i ll land beside it or even on top of it
the ship will still be above my horizon while i m going down so i won t be out of touch for more than ninety minutes
tm convinced that this is the only thing to do
i ve come a billion miles i don t want to be stopped by the last sixty
for weeks as it stared forever sunward with its strange senses the star gate had watched the approaching ship
its makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them
it recognized what was climbing up toward it from the warm heart of the solar system
if it had been alive it would have felt excitement but such an emotion was wholly beyond its powers
even if the ship had passed it by it would not have known the slightest trace of disappointment
it had waited three million years it was prepared to wait for eternity
it observed and noted and took no action as the visitor checked its speed with jets of incandescent gas
presently it felt the gentle touch of radiations trying to probe its secrets
and still it did nothing
now the ship was in orbit circling low above the surface of this strangely piebald moon
it began to speak with blasts of radio waves counting out the prime numbers from 1 to 11 over and over again
soon these gave way to more complex signals at many frequencies ultraviolet infrared x rays
the star gate made no reply it had nothing to say
there was a long pause then before it observed that something was falling down toward it from the orbiting ship
it searched its memories and the logic circuits made their decisions according to the orders given them long ago
beneath the cold light of saturn the star gate awakened its slumbering powers
39 into the eye discovery looked just as he had last seen her from space floating in lunar orbit with the moon taking up half the sky
perhaps there was one slight change be could not be sure but some of the paint of her external lettering announcing the purpose of various hatches connections umbilical plugs and other attachment had faded during its long exposure to the unshielded sun
that sun was now an object that no man would have recognized
it was far too bright to be a star but one could look directly at its tiny disk without discomfort
it gave no heat at all when bowman held his ungloved hands in its rays as they streamed through the space pod s window he could feel nothing upon his skin
he might have been trying to warm himself by the light of the moon not even the alien landscape fifty miles below reminded him more vividly of his remoteness from earth
now he was leaving perhaps for the last time the metal world that had been his home for so many months
even if he never returned the ship would continue to perform its duty broadcasting instrument readings back to earth until there was some final catastrophic failure in its circuits
and if he did return
well he could keep alive and perhaps even sane for a few more months
but that was all for the hibernation systems were useless with no computer to monitor them
he could not possibly survive until discovery ii made its rendezvous with japetus four or five years hence
he put these thoughts behind him as the golden crescent of saturn rose in the sky ahead
in all history he was the only man to have seen this sight
to all other eyes saturn had always shown its whole illuminated disk turned full toward the sun
now it was a delicate bow with the rings forming a thin line across it like an arrow about to be loosed into the face of the sun itself
also in the line of the rings was the bright star of titan and the fainter sparks of the other moons
before this century was half gone men would have visited them all but whatever secrets they might hold he would never know
the sharp edged boundary of the blind white eye was sweeping toward him there was only a hundred miles to go and he would be over his target in less than ten minutes
he wished that there was some way of telling if his words were reaching earth now an hour and a half away at the speed of light
it would be the ultimate irony if through some breakdown in the relay system he disappeared into silence and no one ever knew what had happened to him
discovery was still a brilliant star in the black sky far above
he was pulling ahead as he gained speed during his descent but soon the pod s braking jets would slow him down and the ship would sail on out of sight leaving him alone on this shining plain with the dark mystery at its center
a block of ebony was climbing above the horizon eclipsing the stars ahead
he rolled the pod around its gyros and used full thrust to break his orbital speed
in a long flat arc he descended toward the surface of japetus
on a world of higher gravity the maneuver would have been far too extravagant of fuel
but here the space pod weighed only a score of pounds he had several minutes of hovering time before he would cut dangerously into his reserve and be stranded without any hope of return to the still orbiting discovery
not perhaps that it made much difference his altitude was still about five miles and he was heading straight toward the huge dark mass that soared in such geometrical perfection above the featureless plain
it was as blank as the flat white surface beneath until now he had not appreciated how enormous it really was
there were very few single buildings on earth as large as this his carefully measured photographs indicated a height of almost two thousand feet
and as far as could be judged its proportions were precisely the same as tma l s that curious ratio 1 to 4 to 9
i m only three miles away now holding altitude at four thousand feet
still not a sign of activity nothing on any of the instruments
the faces seem absolutely smooth and polished
surely you d expect some meteorite damage after all this time
and there s no debris on the i suppose one could call it the roof
no sign of any opening either
i d been hoping there might be some way in
now i m right above it hovering five hundred feet up
i don t want to waste any time since discovery will soon be out of range
i m going to land
it s certainly solid enough and if it isn t i ll blast off at once
just a minute that s odd bowman s voice died into the silence of utter bewilderment
he was not alarmed he literally could not describe what he was seeing
he had been hanging above a large flat rectangle eight hundred feet long and two hundred wide made of something that looked as solid as rock
but now it seemed to be receding from him it was exactly like one of those optical illusions when a three dimensional object can by an effort of will appear to turn inside out its near and far sides suddenly interchanging
that was happening to this huge apparently solid structure
impossibly incredibly it was no longer a monolith rearing high above a flat plain
what had seemed to be its roof had dropped away to infinite depths for one dizzy moment he seemed to be looking down into a vertical shaft a rectangular duct which defied the laws of perspective for its size did not decrease with distance
the eye of japetus had blinked as if to remove an irritating speck of dust
david bowman had time for just one broken sentence which the waiting men in mission control nine hundred million miles away and eighty minutes in the future were never to forget the thing s hollow it goes on forever and oh my god
it s full of stars 4 exit the star gate opened
the star gate closed
in a moment of time too short to be measured space turned and twisted upon itself
then japetus was alone once more as it had been for three million years alone except for a deserted but not yet derelict ship sending back to its makers messages which they could neither believe nor understand
vi through the stargate 41 grand central there was no sense of motion but he was falling toward those impossible stars shining there in the dark heart of a moon
no that was not where they really were he felt certain
he wished now that it was far too late that he had paid more attention to those theories of hyperspace of transdimensional ducts
to david bowman they were theories no longer
perhaps that monolith on japetus was hollow perhaps the roof was only an illusion or some kind of diaphragm that had opened to let him through
but into what
as far as he could trust his senses he appeared to be dropping vertically down a huge rectangular shaft several thousand feet deep
he was moving faster and faster but the far end never changed its size and remained always at the same distance from him
only the stars moved at first so slowly that it was some time before he realized that they were escaping out of the frame that held them
but in a little while it was obvious that the star field was expanding as if it was rushing toward him at an inconceivable speed
the expansion was nonlinear the stars at the center hardly seemed to move while those toward the edge accelerated more and more swiftly until they became streaks of light just before they vanished from view
there were always others to replace them flowing into the center of the field from an apparently inexhaustible source
bowman wondered what would happen if a star came straight toward him would it continue to expand until he plunged directly into the face of a sun
but not one came near enough to show a disk eventually they all veered aside and streaked over the edge of their rectangular frame
and still the far end of the shaft came no closer
it was almost as if the walls were moving with him carrying him to his unknown destination
or perhaps he was really motionless and space was moving past him not only space he suddenly realized was involved in whatever was happening to him now
the clock on the pod s small instrument panel was also behaving strangely
normally the numbers in the tenths of a second window flickered past so quickly that it was almost impossible to read them now they were appearing and disappearing at discrete intervals and he could count them off one by one without difficulty
the seconds themselves were passing with incredible slowness as if time itself were coming to a stop
at last the tenth of a second counter froze between 5 and 6
yet he could still think and even observe as the ebon walls flowed past at a speed that might have been anything between zero and a million times the velocity of light
somehow he was not in the least surprised nor was he alarmed
on the contrary he felt a sense of calm expectation such as he had once known when the space medics had tested him with hallucinogenic drugs
the world around him was strange and wonderful but there was nothing to fear
he had traveled these millions of miles in search of mystery and now it seemed the mystery was coming to him
the rectangle ahead was growing lighter
the hominous star streaks were paling against a milky sky whose brilliance increased moment by moment
it seemed as if the space pod was heading toward a bank of cloud uniformly illuminated by the rays of an invisible sun
he was emerging from the tunnel
the far end which until now had remained at that same indeterminate distance neither approaching nor receding had suddenly started to obey the normal laws of perspective
it was coming closer and steadily widening before him
at the same time he felt that he was moving upward and for a fleeting instant he wondered if he had fallen right through japetus and was now ascending from the other side
but even before the space pod soared out into the open he knew that this place had nothing to do with japetus or with any world within the experience of man
there was no atmosphere for he could see all details unblurred clear down to an incredibly remote and flat horizon
he must be above a world of enormous size perhaps one much larger than earth
yet despite its extent all the surface that bowman could see was tessellated into obviously artificia1 patterns that must have been miles on a side
it was like the jigsaw puzzle of a giant that played with planets and at the centers of many of those squares and triangles and polygons were gaping black shafts twins of the chasm from which he had just emerged
yet the sky above was stranger and in its way more disturbing than even the improbable land beneath
for there were no stars neither was there the blackness of space
there was only a softly glowing milkiness that gave the impression of infinite distance
bowman remembered a description he had once heard of the dreaded antarctic whiteout like being inside a ping pong ball those words could be applied perfectly to this weird place but the explanation must be utterly different
this sky could be no meteorological effect of mist and snow there was a perfect vacuum here
then as bowman s eyes grew accustomed to the nacreous glow that filled the heavens he became aware of another detail
the sky was not as he had thought at first glance completely empty
dotted overhead quite motionless and forming apparently random patterns were myriads of tiny black specks
they were difficult to see for they were mere points of darkness but once detected they were quite unmistakable
they reminded bowman of something something so familiar yet so insane that he refused to accept the parallel until logic forced it upon him
those black holes in the white sky were stars he might have been looking at a photographic negative of the milky way
where in god s name am i
bowman asked himself and even as he posed the question he felt certain that he could never know the answer
it seemed that space had been turned inside out this was not a place for man
though the capsule was comfortably warm he felt suddenly cold and was afflicted by an almost uncontrollable trembling
he wanted to close his eyes and shut out the pearly nothingness that surrounded him but that was the act of a coward and he would not yield to it
the pierced and faceted planet slowly rolled beneath him without any real change of scenery
he guessed that he was about ten miles above the surface and should be able to see any signs of life with ease
but this whole world was deserted intelligence had come here worked its will upon it and gone its way again
then he noticed bumped above the flat plain perhaps twenty miles away a roughly cylindrical pile of debris that could only be the carcass of a gigantic ship
it was too distant for him to see any details and it passed out of sight within a few seconds but he could make out broken ribs and dully gleaming sheets of metal that had been partly peeled off like the skin of an orange
he wondered how many thousands of years the wreck had lain here on this deserted checkerboard and what manner of creatures had sailed it between the stars
then he forgot the derelict for something was coming up over the horizon
at first it looked like a flat disk but that was because it was heading almost directly toward him
as it approached and passed beneath he saw that it was spindle shaped and several hundred feet long
though there were faintly visible bands here and there along its length it was hard to focus upon them the object appeared to be vibrating or perhaps spinning at a very rapid rate
it tapered to a point at either end and there was no sign of propulsion
only one thing about it was familiar to human eyes and that was its color
if it was indeed a solid artifact and not an optical phantom then its makers perhaps shared some of the emotions of men
but they certainly did not share their limitations for the spindle appeared to be made of gold
bowman moved his head to the rear view system to watch the thing drop behind
it had ignored him completely and now he saw that it was falling out of the sky down toward one of those thousands of great slots
a few seconds later it disappeared in a final flash of gold as it dived into the planet
he was alone again beneath that sinister sky and the sense of isolation and remoteness was more overwhelming than ever
then he saw that he also was sinking down toward the mottled surface of the giant world and that another of the rectangular chasms yawned immediately below
the empty sky closed above him the clock crawled to rest and once again his pod was falling between infinite ebon walls toward another distant patch of stars
but now he was sure that he was not returning to the solar system and in a flash of insight that might have been wholly spurious he knew what this thing must surely be
it was some kind of cosmic switching device routing the traffic of the stars through unimaginable dimensions of space and time
he was passing through a grand central station of the galaxy
42 the alien sky far ahead the walls of the slot were becoming dimly visible once more in the faint light diffusing downward from some still hidden source
and then the darkness was abruptly whipped away as the tiny space pod hurtled upward into a sky ablaze with stars
he was back in space as he knew it but a single glance told him that he was light centuries from earth
he did not even attempt to find any of the familiar constellations that since the beginning of history had been the friends of man perhaps none of the stars that now blazed around him had ever been seen by the unaided human eye
most of them were concentrated in a glowing belt broken here and there with dark bands of obscuring cosmic dust which completely circled the sky
it was like the milky way but scores of times brighter bowman wondered if this was indeed his own galaxy seen from a point much closer to its brilliant crowded center
he hoped that it was then he would not be so far from home
but this he realized at once was a childish thought
he was so inconceivably remote from the solar system that it made little difference whether he was in his own galaxy or the most distant one that any telescope had ever glimpsed
he looked back to see the thing from which he was rising and had another shock
here was no giant multifaceted world nor any duplicate of japetus
there was nothing except an inky shadow against the stars like a doorway opening from a darkened room into a still darker night
even as he watched that doorway closed
it did not recede from him it slowly filled with stars as if a rent in the fabric of space had been repaired
then he was alone beneath the alien sky
the space pod was slowly turning and as it did so it brought fresh wonders into view
first there was a perfectly spherical swarm of stars becoming more and more closely packed toward the center until its heart was a continuous glow of light
its outer edges were ill defined a slowly thinning halo of suns that merged imperceptibly into the background of more distant stars
this glorious apparition bowman knew was a globular cluster
he was looking upon something that no human eye had ever seen save as a smudge of light in the field of a telescope
he could not remember the distance to the nearest known cluster but he was sure that there were none within a thousand light years of the solar system
the pod continued its slow rotation to disclose an even stranger sight a huge red sun many times larger than the moon as seen from earth
bowman could look straight into its face without discomfort judging by its color it was no hotter than a glowing coal
here and there set into the somber red were rivers of bright yellow incandescent amazons meandering for thousands of miles before they lost themselves in the deserts of this dying sun
dying
no that was a wholly false impression born of human experience and the emotions aroused by the hues of sunset or the glow of fading embers
this was a star that had left behind the fiery extravagances of its youth had raced through the violets and blues and greens of the spectrum in a few fleeting billions of years and now had settled down to a peaceful maturity of unimaginable length
all that had gone before was not a thousandth of what was yet to come the story of this star had barely begun
the pod had ceased to roll the great red sun lay straight ahead
though there was no sense of motion bowman knew that he was still gripped by whatever controlling force had brought him here from saturn
all the science and engineering skill of earth seemed hopelessly primitive now against the powers that were carrying him to some unimaginable fate
he stared into the sky ahead trying to pick out the goal toward which be was being taken perhaps some planet circling this great sun
but there was nothing that showed any visible disk or exceptional brightness if there were planets orbiting here he could not distinguish them from the stellar background
then he noticed that something strange was happening on the very edge of the sun s crimson disk
a white glow had appeared there and was rapidly waxing in brilliance he wondered if he was seeing one of those sudden eruptions or flares that trouble most stars from time to time
the light became brighter and bluer it began to spread along the edge of the sun whose blood red hues paled swiftly by comparison
it was almost bowman told himself smiling at the absurdity of the thought as if be were watching sunrise on a sun
and so indeed he was
above the burning horizon lifted something no larger than a star but so brilliant that the eye could not bear to look upon it
a mere point of blue white radiance like an electric arc was moving at unbelievable speed across the face of the great sun
it must be very close to its giant companion for immediately below it drawn upward by its gravitational pull was a column of flame thousands of miles high
it was as if a tidal wave of fire was marching forever along the equator of this star in vain pursuit of the searing apparition in its sky
that pinpoint of incandescence must be a white dwarf one of those strange fierce little stars no larger than the earth yet containing a million times its mass
such ill matched stellar couples were not uncommon but bowman had never dreamed that one day he would see such a pair with his own eyes
the white dwarf had transited almost half the disk of its companion it must take only minutes to make a complete orbit when bowman was at last certain that he too was moving
ahead of him one of the stars was becoming rapidly brighter and was beginning to drift against its background
it must be some small close body perhaps the world toward which he was traveling
it was upon him with unexpected speed and he saw that it was not a world at all
a dully gleaming cobweb or latticework of metal hundreds of miles in extent grew out of nowhere until it filled the sky
scattered across its continent wide surface were structures that must have been as large as cities but which appeared to be machines
around many of these were assembled scores of smaller objects ranged in neat rows and columns
bowman had passed several such groups before he realized that they were fleets of spaceships he was flying over a gigantic orbital parking lot
because there were no familiar objects by which he could judge the scale of the scene flashing by below it was almost impossible to estimate the size of the vessels hanging there in space
but they were certainly enormous some must have been miles in length
they were of many different designs spheres faceted crystals slim pencils ovoids disks
this must be one of the meeting places for the commerce of the stars
or it had been perhaps a million years ago
for nowhere could bowman see any sign of activity this sprawling spaceport was as dead as the moon
he knew it not only by the absence of all movement but by such unmistakable signs as great gaps torn in the metal cobweb by the wasplike blunderings of asteroids that must have smashed through it eons ago
this was no longer a parking lot it was a cosmic junk heap
he had missed its builders by ages and with that realization bowman felt a sudden sinking of his heart
though he had not known what to expect at least he had hoped to meet some intelligence from the stars
now it seemed he was too late
he had been caught in an ancient automatic trap set for some unknown purpose and still operating when its makers had long since passed away
it had swept him across the galaxy and dumped him with how many others
in this celestial sargasso doomed soon to die when his air was exhausted
well it was unreasonable to expect more
already he had seen wonders for which many men would have sacrificed their lives
he thought of his dead companions he had no cause for complaint
then he saw that the derelict spaceport was still sliding past him with undiminished speed
he was sweeping over its outlying suburbs its ragged edge went by and no longer partially eclipsed the stars
in a few more minutes it had fallen behind
his fate did not lie here but far ahead in the huge crimson sun toward which the space pod was now unmistakably falling
43 inferno now there was only the red sun filling the sky from side to side
he was so close that its surface was no longer frozen into immobility by sheer scale
there were luminous nodules moving to and fro cyclones of ascending and descending gas prominences slowly rocketing toward the heavens
slowly
they must be rising at a million miles an hour for their movement to be visible to his eye
he did not even attempt to grasp the scale of the inferno toward which he was descending
the immensities of saturn and jupiter bad defeated him during discovery s fly by in that solar system now unknown gigamiles away
but everything he saw here was a hundred times larger still he could do nothing but accept the images that were flooding into his mind without attempting to interpret them
as that sea of fire expanded beneath him bowman should have known fear but curiously enough he now felt only a mild apprehension
it was not that his mind was benumbed with wonders logic told him that he must surely be under the protection of some controlling and almost omnipotent intelligence
he was now so close to the red sun that he would have been burned up in a moment if its radiation had not been held at bay by some invisible screen
and during his voyage he had been subjected to accelerations that should have crushed him instantly yet he had felt nothing
if so much trouble had been taken to preserve him there was still cause for hope
the space pod was now moving along a shallow arc almost parallel to the surface of the star but slowly descending toward it
and now for the first time bowman became aware of sounds
there was a faint continuous roar broken from time to time by crackles like tearing paper or distant lightning
this could be only the feeblest echo of an unimaginable cacophony the atmosphere surrounding him must be racked by concussions that could tear any material object to atoms
yet he was protected from this shattering tumult as effectively as from the heat
though ridges of flame thousands of miles high were rising and slowly collapsing around him he was completely insulated from all this violence
the energies of the star raved past him as if they were in another universe the pod moved sedately through their midst un buffeted and unscorched
bowman s eyes no longer hopelessly confused by the strangeness and grandeur of the scene began to pick out details which must have been there before but which he had not yet perceived
the surface of this star was no formless chaos there was pattern here as in everything that nature created
he noticed first the little whirlpools of gas probably no larger than asia or africa that wandered over the surface of the star
sometimes he could look directly down into one of them to see darker cooler regions far below
curiously enough there appeared to be no sunspots perhaps they were a disease peculiar to the star that shone on earth
and there were occasional clouds like wisps of smoke blown before a gale
perhaps they were indeed smoke for this sun was so cold that real fire could exist here
chemical compounds could be born and could live for a few seconds before they were again ripped apart by the fiercer nuclear violence that surrounded them
the horizon was growing brighter its color changing from gloomy red to yellow to blue to blistering violet
the white dwarf was coming up over the horizon dragging its tidal wave of star stuff behind it
bowman shielded his eyes from the intolerable glare of the little sun and focused on the troubled starscape which its gravitational field was sucking skyward
once he had seen a waterspout moving across the face of the caribbean this tower of flame had almost the same shape
only the scale was slightly different for at its base the column was probably wider than the planet earth
and then immediately beneath him bowman noticed something which was surely new since he could hardly have overlooked it if it had been there before
moving across the ocean of glowing gas were myriads of bright beads they shone with a pearly light which waxed and waned in a period of a few seconds
and they were all traveling in the same direction like salmon moving upstream sometimes they weaved back and forth so that their paths intertwined but they never touched
there were thousands of them and the longer bowman stared the more convinced he became that their motion was purposeful
they were too far away for him to make out any details of their structure that be could see them at all in this colossal panorama meant that they must be scores perhaps hundreds of miles across
if they were organized entities they were leviathans indeed built to match the scale of the world they inhabited
perhaps they were only clouds of plasma given temporary stability by some odd combination of natural forces like the short lived spheres of ball lightning that still puzzled terrestrial scientists
that was an easy and perhaps soothing explanation but as bowman looked down upon that star wide streaming he could not really believe it
those glittering nodes of light knew where they were going they were deliberately converging upon the pillar of fire raised by the white dwarf as it orbited overhead
bowman stared once more at that ascending column now marching along the horizon beneath the tiny massive star that ruled it
could it be pure imagination or were there patches of brighter luminosity creeping up that great geyser of gas as if myriads of shining sparks had combined into whole continents of phosphorescence
the idea was almost beyond fantasy but perhaps he was watching nothing less than a migration from star to star across a bridge of fire
whether it was a movement of mindless cosmic beasts driven across space by some lemming like urge or a vast concourse of intelligent entities he would probably never know
he was moving through a new order of creation of which few men had ever dreamed
beyond the realms of sea and land and air and space lay the realms of fire which he alone had been privileged to glimpse
it was too much to expect that he would also understand
44 reception the pillar of fire was marching over the edge of the sun like a storm passing beyond the horizon
the scurrying flecks of light no longer moved across the redly glowing starscape still thousands of miles below
inside his space pod protected from an environment that could annihilate him within a millisecond david bowman awaited whatever had been prepared
the white dwarf was sinking fast as it hurtled along its orbit presently it touched the horizon set it aflame and disappeared
a false twilight fell upon the inferno beneath and in the sudden change of illumination bowman became aware that something was happening in the space around him
the world of the red sun seemed to ripple as if he were looking at it through running water
for a moment he wondered if this was some refractive effect perhaps caused by the passage of an unusually violent shock wave through the tortured atmosphere in which he was immersed
the light was fading it seemed that a second twilight was about to fall
involuntarily bowman looked upward then checked himself sheepishly as he remembered that here the main source of light was not the sky but the blazing world below
it seemed as if walls of some material like smoked glass were thickening around him cutting out the red glow and obscuring the view
it became darker and darker the faint roar of the stellar hurricanes also faded out
the space pod was floating in silence and in night
a moment later there was the softest of bumps as it settled on some hard surface and came to rest
to rest on what
bowman asked himself incredulously
then light returned and incredulity gave way to a heart sinking despair for as he saw what lay around him he knew that he must be mad
he was prepared he thought for any wonder
the only thing he had never expected was the utterly commonplace
the space pod was resting on the polished floor of an elegant anonymous hotel suite that might have been in any large city on earth
he was staring into a living room with a coffee table a divan a dozen chairs a writing desk various lamps a half filled bookcase with some magazines lying on it and even a bowl of flowers
van gogh s bridge at arles was hanging on one wall wyeth s christina s world on another
he felt confident that when he pulled open the drawer of that desk he would find a gideon bible inside it
if he was indeed mad his delusions were beautifully organized
everything was perfectly real nothing vanished when he turned his back
the only incongruous element in the scene and that certainly a major one was the space pod itself
for many minutes bowman did not move from his seat
he half expected the vision around him to go away but it remained as solid as anything be bad ever seen in his life
it was real or else a phantom of the senses so superbly contrived that there was no way of distinguishing it from reality
perhaps it was some kind of test if so not only his fate but that of the human race might well depend upon his actions in the next few minutes
he could sit here and wait for something to happen or he could open the pod and step outside to challenge the reality of the scene around him
the floor appeared to be solid at least it was bearing the weight of the space pod
he was not likely to fall through it whatever it might really be
but there was still the question of air for all that he could tell this room might be in vacuum or might contain a poisonous atmosphere
he thought it very unlikely no one would go to all this trouble without attending to such an essential detail but he did not propose to take unnecessary risks
in any event his years of training made him wary of contamination he was reluctant to expose himself to an unknown environment until he knew that there was no alternative
this place looked like a hotel room somewhere in the united states
that did not alter the fact that in reality he must be hundreds of light years from the solar system
he closed the helmet of his suit sealing himself in and actuated the hatch of the space pod
there was a brief hiss of pressure equalization then he stepped out into the room
as far as he could tell he was in a perfectly normal gravity field
he raised one arm then let it fall freely
it flopped to his side in less than a second
this made everything seem doubly unreal
here he was wearing a spacesuit standing when he should have been floating outside a vehicle which could only function properly in the absence of gravity
all his normal astronaut s reflexes were upset he had to think before he made every movement
like a man in a trance he walked slowly from his bare unfurnished half of the room toward the hotel suite
it did not as he had almost expected disappear as he approached but remained perfectly real and apparently perfectly solid
he stopped beside the coffee table
on it sat a conventional bell system vision phone complete with the local directory
he bent down and picked up the volume with his clumsy gloved hands
it bore in the familiar type he had seen thousands of times the name washington d c then he looked more closely and for the first time he had objective proof that although all this might be real he was not on earth
he could read only the word washington the rest of the printing was a blur as if it had been copied from a newspaper photograph
he opened the book at random and riffled through the pages
they were all blank sheets of crisp white material which was certainly not paper though it looked very much like it
he lifted the telephone receiver and pressed it against the plastic of his helmet
if there had been a dialing sound he could have heard it through the conducting material
but as he had expected there was only silence
so it was all a fake though a fantastically careful one
and it was clearly not intended to deceive but rather he hoped to reassure
that was a very comforting thought nevertheless he would not remove his suit until be had completed his voyage of exploration
all the furniture seemed sound and solid enough he tried the chairs and they supported his weight
but the drawers in the desk would not open they were dummies
so were the books and magazines like the telephone directory only the titles were readable
they formed an odd selection mostly rather trashy best sellers a few sensational works of nonfiction and some well publicized autobiographies
there was nothing less than three years old and little of any intellectual content
not that it mattered for the books could not even be taken down from the shelves
there were two doors that opened readily enough
the first one took him into a small but comfortable bedroom fitted with a bed bureau two chairs light switches that actually worked and a clothes closet
he opened this and found himself looking at four suits a dressing gown a dozen white shirts and several sets of underwear all neatly draped from hangers
he took down one of the suits and inspected it carefully
as far as his gloved hands could judge it was made of material that was more like fur than wool
it was also a little out of style on earth no one had been wearing single breasted suits for at least four years
next to the bedroom was a bathroom complete with fittings which he was relieved to note were not dummies but worked in a perfectly normal manner
and after that was a kitchenette with electric cooker refrigerator storage cupboards crockery and cutlery sink table and chairs
bowman began to explore this not only with curiosity but with mounting hunger
first he opened the refrigerator and a wave of cold mist rolled out
the shelves were well stocked with packages and cans all of them looking perfectly familiar from a distance though at close quarters their proprietary labels were blurred and unreadable
however there was a notable absence of eggs milk butter meat fruit or any other unprocessed food the refrigerator held only items that had already been packaged in some way
bowman picked up a carton of a familiar breakfast cereal thinking as he did so that it was odd to keep this frozen
the moment he lifted the package he knew that it certainly did not contain cornflakes it was much too heavy
he ripped open the lid and examined the contents
the box contained a slightly moist blue substance of about the weight and texture of bread pudding
apart from its odd color it looked quite appetizing
but this is ridiculous bowman told himself
i am almost certainly being watched and i must look an idiot wearing this suit
if this is some kind of intelligence test i ve probably failed already
without further hesitation he walked back into the bedroom and began to undo the clamp of his helmet
when it was loose he lifted the helmet a fraction of an inch cracked the seal and took a cautious sniff
as far as he could tell he was breathing perfectly normal air
he dropped the helmet on the bed and began thankfully and rather stiffly to divest himself of his suit
when he had finished he stretched took a few deep breaths and carefully hung the spacesuit up among the more conventional articles of clothing in the closet
it looked rather odd there but the compulsive tidiness that bowman shared with all astronauts would never have allowed him to leave it anywhere else
then he walked quickly back into the kitchen and began to inspect the cereal box at closer quarters
the blue bread pudding had a faint spicy smell something like a macaroon
bowman weighed it in his hand then broke off a piece and cautiously sniffed at it
though he felt sure now that there would be no deliberate attempt to poison him there was always the possibility of mistakes especially in a matter so complex as biochemistry
he nibbled at a few crumbs then chewed and swallowed the fragment of food it was excellent though the flavor was so elusive as to be almost indescribable
if he closed his eyes he could imagine it was meat or wholemeal bread or even dried fruit
unless there were unexpected aftereffects he had no cause to fear starvation
when he had eaten just a few mouthfuls of the substance and already felt quite satisfied he looked for something to drink
there were half a dozen cans of beer again of a famous brand at the back of the refrigerator and he pressed the tab on one of them to open it
the prestressed metal lid popped off along its strain lines exactly as usual
but the can did not contain beer to bowman s surprised disappointment it held more of the blue food
in a few seconds he had opened half a dozen of the other packages and cans
whatever their labels their contents were the same it seemed that his diet was going to be a little monotonous and that he would have nothing but water to drink
he filled a glass from the kitchen faucet and sipped at it cautiously
he spat out the first few drops at once the taste was terrible
then rather ashamed of his instinctive reaction he forced himself to drink the rest
that first sip had been enough to identify the liquid
it tasted terrible because it had no taste at all the faucet was supplying pure distilled water
his unknown hosts were obviously taking no chances with his health
feeling much refreshed he then had a quick shower
there was no soap which was another minor inconvenience but there was a very efficient hot air drier in which be luxuriated for a while before trying on underpants vest and dressing gown from the clothes closet
after that he lay down on the bed stared up at the ceiling and tried to make sense of this fantastic situation
he had made little progress when he was distracted by another line of thought
immediately above the bed was the usual hotel type ceiling tv screen he had assumed that like the telephone and books it was a dummy
but the control unit on its swinging bedside arm looked so realistic that he could not resist playing with it and as his fingers touched the on sensor disk the screen lit up
feverishly he started to tap out channel selector codes at random and almost at once he got his first picture
it was a well known african news commentator discussing the attempts being made to preserve the last remnants of his country s wild life
bowman listened for a few seconds so captivated by the sound of a human voice that he did not in the least care what it was talking about
then he changed channels
in the next five minutes he got a symphony orchestra playing walton s violin concerto a discussion on the sad state of the legitimate theater a western a demonstration of a new headache cure a panel game in some oriental language a psychodrama three news commentaries a football game a lecture on solid geometry in russian and several tuning signals and data transmissions
it was in fact a perfectly normal selection from the world s tv programs and apart from the psychological uplift it gave him it confirmed one suspicion that had already been forming in his mind
all the programs were about two years old
that was around the time tma 1 had been discovered and it was hard to believe that this was a pure coincidence
something had been monitoring the radio waves that ebon block had been busier than men had suspected
he continued to wander across the spectrum and suddenly recognized a familiar scene
here was this very suite now occupied by a celebrated actor who was furiously denouncing an unfaithful mistress
bowman looked with a shock of recognition upon the living room he had just left and when the camera followed the indignant couple toward the bedroom he involuntarily looked toward the door to see if anyone was entering
so that was how this reception area had been prepared for him his hosts had based their ideas of terrestrial living upon tv programs
his feeling that he was inside a movie set was almost literally true
he had learned all that he wished to for the moment and turned off the set
what do i do now
he asked himself locking his fingers behind his head and staring up at the blank screen
he was physically and emotionally exhausted yet it seemed impossible that one could sleep in such fantastic surroundings and farther from earth than any man in history had ever been
but the comfortable bed and the instinctive wisdom of the body conspired together against his will
he fumbled for the light switch and the room was plunged into darkness
within seconds he had passed beyond the reach of dreams
so for the last time david bowman slept
45 recapitulation there being no further use for it the furniture of the suite dissolved back into the mind of its creator
only the bed remained and the walls shielding this fragile organism from the energies it could not yet control
in his sleep david bowman stirred restlessly
he did not wake nor did he dream but he was no longer wholly unconscious
like a fog creeping through a forest something invaded his mind
he sensed it only dimly for the full impact would have destroyed him as surely as the fires raging beyond these walls
beneath that dispassionate scrutiny he felt neither hope nor fear all emotion had been leached away
he seemed to be floating in free space while around him stretched in all directions an infinite geometrical grid of dark lines or threads along which moved tiny nodes of light some slowly some at dazzling speed
once he had peered through a microscope at a cross section of a human brain and in its network of nerve fibers had glimpsed the same labyrinthine complexity
but that had been dead and static whereas this transcended life itself
he knew or believed he knew that he was watching the operation of some gigantic mind contemplating the universe of which he was so tiny a part
the vision or illusion lasted only a moment
then the crystalline planes and lattices and the interlocking perspectives of moving light flickered out of existence as david bowman moved into a realm of consciousness that no man had experienced before
at first it seemed that time itself was running backward
even this marvel he was prepared to accept before be realized the subtler truth
the springs of memory were being tapped in controlled recollection he was reliving the past
there was the hotel suite there the space pod there the burning starscapes of the red sun there the shining core of the galaxy there the gateway through which he had reemerged into the universe
and not only vision but all the sense impressions and all the emotions he had felt at the time were racing past more and more swiftly
his life was unreeling like a tape recorder playing back at ever increasing speed
now he was once more aboard the discovery and the rings of saturn filled the sky
before that he was repeating his final dialogue with hal he was seeing frank poole leave on his last mission he was hearing the voice of earth assuring him that all was well
and even as he relived these events he knew that all indeed was well
he was retrogressing down the corridors of time being drained of knowledge and experience as he swept back toward his childhood
but nothing was being lost all that be had ever been at every moment of his life was being transferred to safer keeping
even as one david bowman ceased to exist another became immortal
faster faster he moved back into forgotten years and into a simpler world
faces he had once loved and had thought lost beyond recall smiled at him sweetly
he smiled back with fondness and without pain
now at last the headlong regression was slackening the wells of memory were nearly dry
time flowed more and more sluggishly approaching a moment of stasis as a swinging pendulum at the limit of its arc seems frozen for one eternal instant before the next cycle begins
the timeless instant passed the pendulum reversed its swing
in an empty room floating amid the fires of a double star twenty thousand light years from earth a baby opened its eyes and began to cry
46 transformation then it became silent as it saw that it was no longer alone
a ghostly glimmering rectangle had formed in the empty air
it solidified into a crystal tablet lost its transparency and became suffused with a pale milky luminescence
tantalizing ill defined phantoms moved across its surface and in its depths
they coalesced into bars of lights and shadow then formed intermeshing spoked patterns that began slowly to rotate in time with the pulsing rhythm that now seemed to fill the whole of space
it was a spectacle to grasp and hold the attention of any child or of any man ape
but as it had been three million years before it was only the outward manifestation of forces too subtle to be consciously perceived
it was merely a toy to distract the senses while the real processing was carried out at far deeper levels of the mind
this time the processing was swift and certain as the new design was woven
for in the eons since their last meeting much had been learned by the weaver and the material on which he practiced his art was now of an infinitely finer texture
but whether it should be permitted to form part of his still growing tapestry only the future could tell
with eyes that already held more than human intentness the baby stared into the depths of the crystal monolith seeing but not yet understanding the mysteries that lay beyond
it knew that it had come home that here was the origin of many races besides its own but it knew also that it could not stay
beyond this moment lay another birth stranger than any in the past
now the moment had come the glowing patterns no longer echoed the secrets in the crystal s heart
as they died so too the protective walls faded back into the nonexistence from which they bad briefly emerged and the red sun filled the sky
the metal and plastic of the forgotten space pod and the clothing once worn by an entity who had called himself david bowman flashed into flame
the last links with earth were gone resolved back into their component atoms
but the child scarcely noticed as he adjusted himself to the comfortable glow of his new environment
he still needed for a little while this shell of matter as the focus of his powers
his indestructible body was his mind s present image of itself and for all his powers he knew that he was still a baby
so he would remain until he had decided on a new form or had passed beyond the necessities of matter
and now it was time to go though in one sense he would never leave this place where he had been reborn for he would always be part of the entity that used this double star for its unfathomable purposes
the direction though not the nature of his destiny was clear before him and there was no need to trace the devious path by which he had come
with the instincts of three million years he now perceived that there were more ways than one behind the back of space
the ancient mechanisms of the star gate had served him well but he would not need them again
the glimmering rectangular shape that had once seemed no more than a slab of crystal still floated before him indifferent as he was to the harmless flames of the inferno beneath
it encapsulated yet unfathomed secrets of space and time but some at least he now understood and was able to command
how obvious how necessary was that mathematical ratio of its sides the quadratic sequence 1 4 9
and how naive to have imagined that the series ended at this point in only three dimensions
he focused his mind upon these geometrical simplicities and as his thoughts brushed against it the empty framework filled with the darkness of the interstellar night
the glow of the red sun faded or rather seemed to recede in all directions at once and there before him was the luminous whirlpool of the galaxy
it might have been some beautiful incredibly detailed model embedded in a block of plastic
but it was the reality grasped as a whole with senses now more subtle than vision
if he wished he could focus his attention upon any one of its hundred billion stars and he could do much more than that
here he was adrift in this great river of suns halfway between the banked fires of the galactic core and the lonely scattered sentinel stars of the rim
and here he wished to be on the far side of this chasm in the sky this serpentine band of darkness empty of all stars
he knew that this formless chaos visible only by the glow that limned its edges from fire mists far beyond was the still unused stuff of creation the raw material of evolutions yet to be
here time had not begun not until the suns that now burned were long since dead would light and life reshape this void
unwittingly he had crossed it once now he must cross it again this time of his own volition
the thought filled him with a sudden freezing terror so that for a moment he was wholly disorientated and his new vision of the universe trembled and threatened to shatter into a thousand fragments
it was not fear of the galactic gulfs that chilled his soul but a more profound disquiet stemming from the unborn future
for he had left behind the time scales of his human origin now as he contemplated that band of starless night he knew his first intimations of the eternity that yawned before him
then he remembered that he would never be alone and his panic slowly ebbed
the crystal clear perception of the universe was restored to him not he knew wholly by his own efforts
when he needed guidance in his first faltering steps it would be there
confident once more like a high diver who had regained his nerve he launched himself across the light years
the galaxy burst forth from the mental frame in which he had enclosed it stars and nebulae poured past him in an illusion of infinite speed
phantom suns exploded and fell behind as he slipped like a shadow through their cores the cold dark waste of cosmic dust which he had once feared seemed no more than the beat of a raven s wing across the face of the sun
the stars were thinning out the glare of the milky way was dimming into a pale ghost of the glory he had known and when he was ready would know again
he was back precisely where he wished to be in the space that men called real
47 star child there before him a glittering toy no star child could resist floated the planet earth with all its peoples
he had returned in time
down there on that crowded globe the alarms would be flashing across the radar screens the great tracking telescopes would be searching the skies and history as men knew it would be drawing to a close
a thousand miles below he became aware that a slumbering cargo of death had awoken and was stirring sluggishly in its orbit
the feeble energies it contained were no possible menace to him but he preferred a cleaner sky
he put forth his will and the circling megatons flowered in a silent detonation that brought a brief false dawn to half the sleeping globe
then he waited marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers
for though he was master of the world he was not quite sure what to do next
but he would think of something
i leonov 1 meeting at the focus even in this metric age it was still the thousand foot telescope not the three hundred metre one
the great saucer set among the mountains was already half full of shadow as the tropical sun dropped swiftly to rest but the triangular raft of the antenna complex suspended high above its centre still blazed with light
from the ground far below it would have taken keen eyes to notice the two human figures in the aerial maze of girders support cables and wave guides
the time has come said dr dimitri moisevitch to his old friend heywood floyd to talk of many things
of shoes and spaceships and sealing wax but mostly of monoliths and malfunctioning computers so that s why you got me away from the conference
not that i really mind i ve heard carl give that seti speech so many times that i can recite it myself
and the view certainly is fantastic you know all the times i ve been to arecibo i ve never made it up here to the antenna feed shame on you
i ve been here three times
imagine we re listening to the whole universe but no one can overhear us
so let s talk about your problem what problem to start with why you had to resign as chairman of the national council on astronautics i didn t resign
the university of hawaii pays a lot better okay you didn t resign you were one jump ahead of them
after all these years woody you can t fool me and you should give up trying
if they offered the nca back to you right now would you hesitate all right you old cossak
what do you want to know first of all there are lots of loose ends in the report you finally issued after so much prodding
we ll overlook the ridiculous and frankly illegal secrecy with which your people dug up the tycho monolith that wasn t my idea glad to hear it i even believe you
and we appreciate the fact that you re now letting everyone examine the thing which of course is what you should have done in the first place
not that it s done much good there was a gloomy silence while the two men contemplated the black enigma up there on the moon still contemptuously defying all the weapons that human ingenuity could bring to bear upon it
then the russian scientist continued
anyway whatever the tycho monolith may be there s something more important out at jupiter
that s where it sent its signal after all
and that s where your people ran into trouble
sorry about that by the way though frank poole was the only one i knew personally
met him at the 98 iaf congress he seemed a good man thank you they were all good men
i wish we knew what happened to them whatever it was surely you ll admit that it now concerns the whole human race not merely the united states
you can no longer try to use your knowledge for purely national advantage dimitri you know perfectly well that your side would have done exactly the same thing
and you d have helped you re absolutely right
but that s ancient history like the just departed administration of yours that was responsible for the whole mess
with a new president perhaps wiser counsels will prevail possibly
do you have any suggestions and are they official or just personal hopes entirely unofficial at the moment
what the bloody politicians call exploratory talks
which i shall flatly deny ever occurred fair enough
go on okay here s the situation
you re assembling discovery 2 in parking orbit as quickly as you can but you can t hope to have it ready in less than three years which means you ll miss the next launch window i neither confirm nor deny
remember i m merely a humble university chancellor the other side of the world from the astronautics council and your last trip to washington was just a holiday to see old friends i suppose
to continue our own alexei leonov i thought you were calling it gherman titov wrong chancellor
the dear old cia s let you down again
leonov it is as of last january
and don t let anyone know i told you it will reach jupiter at least a year ahead of discovery don t let anyone know i told you we were afraid of that
but do go on because my bosses are just as stupid and shortsighted as yours they want to go it alone
which means that whatever went wrong with you may happen to us and we ll all be back to square one or worse what do you think went wrong
we re just as baffled as you are
and don t tell me you haven t got all of dave bowman s transmissions of course we have
right up to that last my god it s full of stars we ve even done a stress analysis on his voice patterns
we don t think he was hallucinating he was trying to describe what he actually saw and what do you make of his doppler shift completely impossible of course
when we lost his signal he was receding at a tenth of the speed of light
and he d reached that in less than two minutes
a quarter of a million gravities so he must have been killed instantly don t pretend to be naive woody
your space pod radios aren t built to withstand even a hundredth of that acceleration
if they could survive so could bowman at least until we lost contact just doing an independent check on your deductions
from there on we re as much in the dark as you are
if you are merely playing with lots of crazy guesses i d be ashamed to tell you
yet none of them i suspect will be half as crazy as the truth in small crimson explosions the navigation warning lights winked on all around them and the three slim towers supporting the antenna complex began to blaze like beacons against the darkling sky
the last red sliver of the sun vanished below the surrounding hills heywood floyd waited for the green flash which he had never seen
once again he was disappointed
so dimitri he said let s get to the point
just what are you driving at there must be a vast amount of priceless information stored in discovery s data banks presumably it s still being gathered even though the ship s stopped transmitting
we d like to have that fair enough
but when you get out there and leonov makes a rendezvous what s to prevent you from boarding discovery and copying everything you want i never thought i d have to remind you that discovery is united states territory and an unauthorized entry would be piracy except in the event of a life or death emergency which wouldn t be difficult to arrange
after all it would be hard for us to check what your boys were up to from a billion kilometres away thanks for the most interesting suggestion i ll pass it on
but even if we went aboard it would take us weeks to learn all your systems and read out all your memory banks
what i propose is cooperation
i m convinced that s the best idea but we may both have a job selling it to our respective bosses you want one of our astronauts to fly with leonov yes preferably an engineer who s specialized in discovery s systems
like the ones you re training at houston to bring the ship home how did you know that for heaven s sake woody it was on aviation week s videotext at least a month ago i am out of touch nobody tells me what s been declassified all the more reason to spend time in washington
will you back me up absolutely
i agree with you one hundred per cent
but but what we both have to deal with dinosaurs with brains in their tails
some of mine will argue let the russians risk their necks hurrying out to jupiter
we ll be there anyway a couple of years later and what s the hurry for a moment there was silence on the antenna raft except for a faint creak from the immense supporting cables that held it suspended a hundred metres in the sky
then moisevitch continued so quietly that floyd had to strain to hear him has anyone checked discovery s orbit lately i really don t know but i suppose so
anyway why bother
it s a perfectly stable one indeed
let me tactlessly remind you of an embarrassing incident from the old nasa days
your first space station skylab
it was supposed to stay up at least a decade but you didn t do your calculations right
the air drag in the ionosphere was badly underestimated and it came down years ahead of schedule
i m sure you remember that little cliffhanger even though you were a boy at the time it was the year i graduated and you know it
but discovery doesn t go anywhere near jupiter
even at perigee er perijove it s much too high to be affected by atmospheric drag i ve already said enough to get me exiled to my dacha again and you might not be allowed to visit me next time
so just ask your tracking people to do their job more carefully will you
and remind them that jupiter has the biggest magnetosphere in the solar system i understand what you re driving at many thanks
anything else before we go down
i m starting to freeze don t worry old friend
as soon as you let all this filter through to washington wait a week or so until i m clear things are going to get very very hot 2 the house of the dolphins the dolphins swam into the dining room every evening just before sunset
only once since floyd had occupied the chancellor s residence had they broken their routine
that was the day of the 5 tsunami which fortunately had lost most of its power before it reached hilo
the next time his friends failed to turn up on schedule floyd would throw the family into the car and head for high ground in the general direction of mauna kea
charming though they were he had to admit that their playfulness was sometimes a nuisance
the wealthy marine geologist who had designed the house had never minded getting wet because he usually wore bathing trunks or less
but there had been one unforgettable occasion when the entire board of regents in full evening attire had been sipping cocktails around the pool while awaiting the arrival of a distinguished guest from the mainland
the dolphins had deduced correctly that they would get second billing
so the visitor was quite surprised to be greeted by a bedraggled committee in ill fitting bathrobes and the buffet had been very salty
floyd often wondered what marion would have thought of his strange and beautiful home on the edge of the pacific
she had never liked the sea but the sea had won in the end
though the image was slowly fading he could still recall the flashing screen on which he had first read the words dr floyd urgent and personal
and then the scrolling lines of fluorescent print that had swiftly burned their message into his mind regret to inform you london washington flight 452 reported down off newfoundland
rescue craft proceeding to location but fear no survivors
apart from an accident of fate he would have been on that flight
for a few days he had almost regretted the european space administration business that had delayed him in paris that haggle over the solaris payload had saved his life
and now he had a new job a new home and a new wife
fate had also played an ironic role here
the recriminations and inquiries over the jupiter mission had destroyed his washington career but a man of his ability was never unemployed for long
the more leisurely tempo of university life had always appealed to him and when combined with one of the world s most beautiful locations it had proved irresistible
he had met the woman who was to be his second wife only a month after he had been appointed while watching the fire fountains of kilauea with a crowd of tourists
with caroline he had found the contentment that is just as important as happiness and longer lasting
she had been a good stepmother to marion s two daughters and had given him christopher
despite the twenty year age difference between them she understood his moods and could wean him out of his occasional depressions
thanks to her he could now contemplate the memory of marion without grief though not without a wistful sadness that would remain with him for the rest of his life
caroline was throwing fish to the largest dolphin the big male they called scarback when a gentle tickling on floyd s wrist announced an incoming call
he tapped the slim metal band to quench the silent alarm and forestall the audible one then walked to the nearest of the comsets scattered around the room
chancellor here
who s calling heywood
this is victor
how are you in a fraction of a second a whole kaleidoscope of emotions flashed through floyd s mind
first there was annoyance his successor and he was sure principal contriver of his downfall had never once attempted to contact him since his departure from washington
then came curiosity what did they have to talk about
next was a stubborn determination to be as unhelpful as possible then shame at his own childishness and finally a surge of excitement
victor millson could be calling for only one reason
in as neutral a voice as he could muster floyd answered i can t complain victor
what s the problem is this a secure circuit no thank god
i don t need them any more um
well i ll put it this way
you recall the last project you administered i m not likely to forget especially as the subcommittee on astronautics called me back to give more evidence only a month ago of course of course
i really must get around to reading your statement when i have a moment
but i ve been so busy with the follow up and that s the problem i thought that everything was right on schedule it is unfortunately
there s nothing we can do to advance it even the highest priority would make only a few weeks difference
and that means we ll be too late i don t understand said floyd innocently
though we don t want to waste time of course there s no real deadline now there is and two of them you amaze me if victor noticed any irony he ignored it
yes there are two deadlines one man made one not
it now turns out that we won t be the first to get back to the er scene of the action
our old rivals will beat us by at least a year too bad that s not the worst
even if there were no competition we d be too late
there wouldn t be anything there when we arrive that s ridiculous
i m sure i d have heard if congress had repealed the law of gravitation i m serious
the situation isn t stable i can t give details now
will you be in for the rest of the evening yes floyd answered realizing with some pleasure that it must now be well after midnight in washington
good
you ll have a package delivered within the hour
call me back as soon as you ve had the time to study it won t it be rather late by then yes it will be
but we ve wasted too much time already
i don t want to lose any more millson was true to his word
exactly an hour later a large sealed envelope was delivered by an air force colonel no less who sat patiently chatting with caroline while floyd read its contents
i m afraid i ll have to take it away when you ve finished the high ranking messenger boy said apologetically
i m glad to hear it floyd answered as he settled down in his favourite reading hammock
there were two documents the first very short
it was stamped top secret though the top had been crossed out and the modification endorsed by three signatures all completely illegible
obviously an extract from some much longer report it had been heavily censored and was full of blanks which made it most annoying to read
fortunately its conclusions could be summed up in one sentence the russians would reach discovery long before its rightful owners could do so
as floyd already knew this he turned quickly to the second document though not before noticing with satisfaction that this time they d managed to get the name right
as usual dimitri had been perfectly accurate
the next manned expedition to jupiter would travel aboard spacecraft cosmonaut alexei leonov
the second document was much longer and was merely confidential indeed it was in the form of a draft letter to science awaiting final approval before publication
its snappy title was space vehicle discovery anomalous orbital behavior
then followed a dozen pages of mathematics and astronomical tables
floyd skimmed through these picking out the words from the music and trying to detect any note of apology or even embarrassment
when he had finished he was compelled to give a smile of wry admiration
no one could possibly guess that the tracking stations and ephemeris calculators had been caught by surprise and that a frantic cover up was in progress
heads would doubtless roll and he knew that victor millson would enjoy rolling them if his was not one of the first to go
though to do him justice victor had complained when congress had cut funds for the tracking network
maybe that would get him off the hook
thank you colonel said floyd when he had finished skimming the papers
quite like old times having classified documents
that s one thing i don t miss the colonel placed the envelope carefully back in his briefcase and activated the locks
dr millson would like you to return his call as soon as possible i know
but i don t have a secure circuit i ve some important visitors coming shortly and i m damned if i m driving down to your office in hilo just to say i ve read two documents
tell him that i ve studied them carefully and await any further communication with interest for a moment it looked as if the colonel was going to argue
then he thought better of it made a stiff farewell and departed morosely into the night
now what was all that about asked caroline
we re not expecting any visitors tonight important or otherwise i hate being pushed around particularly by victor millson bet he calls you back as soon as the colonel reports then we must switch off video and make some party noises
but to be perfectly truthful at this stage i really don t have anything to say about what if i m allowed to ask sorry dear
it seems that discovery is playing tricks on us
we thought the ship was in a stable orbit but it may be about to crash into jupiter oh no that s quite impossible
bowman left it parked at the inner lagrange point on the line between jupiter and io
it should have stayed there more or less though the perturbations of the outer moons would have made it wander back and forth
but what s happening now is something very odd and we don t know the full explanation
discovery s drifting more and more rapidly toward io though sometimes it accelerates and sometimes even moves backward
if it keeps this up it will impact within two or three years i thought this couldn t happen in astronomy
isn t celestial mechanics supposed to be an exact science
so we poor backward biologists were always being told it is an exact science when everything is taken into account
but some very strange things go on around io
apart from its volcanoes there are tremendous electrical discharges and jupiter s magnetic field is spinning round every ten hours
so gravitation isn t the only force acting on discovery we should have thought of this sooner much sooner well it s not your problem anymore
you should be thankful for that your problem the very expression that dimitri had used
and dimitri cunning old fox
had known him much longer than caroline
it might not be his problem but it was still his responsibility
though many others had been involved in the final analysis he had approved the plans for the jupiter mission and supervised their execution
even at the time he had had qualms his views as a scientist had conflicted with his duties as a bureaucrat
he could have spoken out and opposed the old administration s shortsighted policies though to what extent those had actually contributed to the disaster was still uncertain
perhaps it was best if he closed this chapter of his life and focused all his thoughts and energies upon his new career
but in his heart he knew that was impossible even if dimitri had not revived old guilts they would have surfaced of their own accord
four men had died and one had disappeared out there among the moons of jupiter
there was blood on his hands and he did not know how to wash them clean
3 sal 9 dr sivasubramanian chandrasegarampillai professor of computer science at the university of illinois urbana also had an abiding sense of guilt but one very different from heywood floyd s
those of his students and colleagues who often wondered if the little scientist was quite human would not have been surprised to learn that he never thought of the dead astronauts
dr chandra grieved only for his lost child hal 9
even after all these years and his endless reviews of the data radioed back from discovery he was not sure what had gone wrong
he could only formulate theories the facts he needed were frozen in hal s circuits out there between jupiter and io
the sequence of events had been clearly established up to the moment of the tragedy thereafter commander bowman had filled in a few more details on the brief occasions when he had re established contact
but knowing what happened did not explain why
the first hint of trouble had been late in the mission when hal had reported the imminent failure of the unit that kept discovery s main antenna aligned to earth
if the half billion kilometre long radio beam wandered off target the ship would be blind deaf and dumb
bowman himself had gone out to retrieve the suspect unit but when it was tested it appeared to everyone s surprise to be in perfectly good order
the automatic checking circuits could find nothing wrong with it
nor could hal s twin sal 9 back on earth when the information was transmitted to urbana
but hal had insisted on the accuracy of his diagnosis making pointed remarks about human error
he had suggested that the control unit be put back in the antenna until it finally failed so that the fault could be precisely located
no one could think of any objection for the unit could be replaced in minutes even if it did break down
bowman and poole however had not been happy they both felt that something was wrong though neither could pinpoint it
for months they had accepted hal as the third member of their tiny world and knew his every mood
then the atmosphere aboard the ship had subtly altered there was a sense of strain in the air
feeling rather like traitors as a distraught bowman had later reported to mission control the human two thirds of the crew had discussed what should be done if their colleague was indeed malfunctioning
in the worst possible case hal would have to be relieved of all his higher responsibilities
this would involve disconnection the computer equivalent of death
despite their doubts they had carried out the agreed programme
poole had flown out of discovery in one of the little space pods that served as transporters and mobile workshops during extravehicular activities
since the somewhat tricky job of replacing the antenna unit could not be performed by the pod s own manipulators poole had started to do it himself
what happened then had been missed by the external cameras which was a suspicious detail in itself
bowman s first warning of disaster was a cry from poole then silence
a moment later he saw poole tumbling over and over spinning away into space
his own pod had rammed him and was itself blasting away out of control
as bowman admitted later he had then made several serious mistakes all but one excusable
in the hope of rescuing poole if he was still alive bowman launched himself in another space pod leaving hal in full control of the ship
the eva was in vain poole was dead when bowman reached him
numb with despair he had carried the body back to the ship only to be refused entry by hal
but hal had underestimated human ingenuity and determination
though he had left his suit helmet in the ship and thus had to risk direct exposure to space bowman forced his way in by an emergency hatch not under computer control
then he proceeded to lobotomize hal unplugging his brain modules one by one
when he regained control of the ship bowman made an appalling discovery
during his absence hal had switched off the life support systems of the three hibernating astronauts
bowman was alone as no man had ever been before in the whole of human history
others might have abandoned themselves in helpless despair but now david bowman proved that those who had selected him had indeed chosen well
he managed to keep discovery operational and even re established intermittent contact with mission control by orienting the whole ship so that the jammed antenna pointed toward earth
on its preordained trajectory discovery had finally arrived at jupiter
there bowman had encountered orbiting among the moons of the giant planet a black slab of exactly the same shape as the monolith excavated in the lunar crater tycho but hundreds of times larger
he had gone out in a space pod to investigate and had disappeared leaving that final baffling message my god it s full of stars that mystery was for others to worry about dr chandra s overwhelming concern was with hal
if there was one thing his unemotional mind hated it was uncertainty
he would never be satisfied until he knew the cause of hal s behaviour
even now he refused to call it a malfunction at most it was an anomaly
the tiny cubbyhole he used as his inner sanctum was equipped only with a swivel chair a desk console and a blackboard flanked by two photographs
few members of the general public could have identified the portraits but anyone permitted thus far would have recognized them instantly as john von neumann and alan turing the twin gods of the computing pantheon
there were no books and not even paper and pencil on the desk
all the volumes in all the libraries of the world were instantly available at the touch of chandra s fingers and the visual display was his sketchbook and writing pad
even the blackboard was used only for visitors the last half erased block diagram upon it bore a date already three weeks in the past
dr chandra lit one of the venomous cheroots which he imported from madras and which were widely and correctly believed to be his only vice
the console was never switched off he checked that no messages were flashing importantly on the display then spoke into the microphone
good morning sal
so you ve nothing new for me no dr chandra
have you anything for me the voice might have been that of any cultured hindu lady educated in the united states as well as her own country
sal s accent had not started that way but over the years she had picked up many of chandra s intonations
the scientist tapped out a code on the board switching sal s inputs to the memory with the highest security rating
no one knew that he talked to the computer on this circuit as he never could to a human being
no matter that sal did not really understand more than a fraction of what he said her responses were so convincing that even her creator was sometimes deceived
as indeed he wished to be these secret communications helped to preserve his mental equilibrium perhaps even his sanity
you ve often told me sal that we cannot solve the problem of hal s anomalous behaviour without more information
but how can we get that information that is obvious
someone must return to discovery exactly
now it looks as if that is going to happen sooner than we expected i am pleased to hear that i knew that you would be answered chandra and meant it
he had long since broken off communications with the dwindling body of philosophers who argued that computers could not really feel emotions but only pretended to do so
if you can prove to me that you re not pretending to be annoyed he had once retorted scornfully to one such critic i ll take you seriously at that point his opponent had put on a most convincing imitation of anger
now i want to explore another possibility chandra continued
diagnosis is only the first step
the process is incomplete unless it leads to a cure you believe that hal can be restored to normal functioning i hope so
i do not know
there may have been irreversible damage and certainly major loss of memory he paused thoughtfully took several puffs then blew a skilful smoke ring that scored a bull s eye on sal s wideangle lens
a human being would not have regarded this as a friendly gesture that was yet another of the many advantages of computers
i need your cooperation sal of course dr chandra there may be certain risks what do you mean i propose to disconnect some of your circuits particularly those involving your higher functions
does this disturb you i am unable to answer that without more specific information very well
let me put it this way
you have operated continuously have you not since you were first switched on that is correct but you are aware that we human beings cannot do so
we require sleep an almost complete break in our mental functioning at least on the conscious level i know this
but i do not understand it well you may be about to experience something like sleep
probably all that will happen is that time will pass but you will be unaware out
when you check your internal clock you will discover that there are gaps in your monitor record
that is all but you said that there might be risks
what are they there is a very slight chance it is impossible to compute it that when i reconnect your circuits there may be some changes in your personality your future behaviour patterns
you may feel different
not necessarily better or worse i do not know what that means i m sorry it may not mean anything
so don t worry about it
now please open a new file here is the name using the keyboard input chandra typed out phoenix
do you know what that is he asked sal
with no discernible pause the computer replied there are twenty five references in the current encyclopedia which one do you think is relevant the tutor of achilles interesting
i didn t know that one
try again a fabulous bird reborn from the ashes of its earlier life excellent
now do you understand why i chose it because you hope that hal can be reactivated yes with your assistance
are you ready not yet
i would like to ask a question what is it will i dream of course you will
all intelligent creatures dream but no one knows why chandra paused for a moment blew another smoke ring from the cheroot and added something that he would never admit to a human being
perhaps you will dream about hal as i often do 4 mission profile english version to captain tatiana tanya orlova commander
spacecraft cosmonaut alexei leonov uncos registration 81342
from national council on astronautics pennsylvania avenue washington commission on outer space ussr academy of science korolyev prospect moscow mission objectives the objectives of your mission are in order of priority 1
to proceed to the jovian system and rendezvous with us spacecraft discovery uncos 1 283
2
to board this spacecraft and obtain all possible information relating to its earlier mission
3
to reactivate spacecraft discovery s onboard systems and if propellant supplies are adequate inject the ship into an earth returns trajectory
4 to locate the alien artifact encountered by discovery and to investigate it to the maximum extent possible by remote sensors
5
if it seems advisable and mission control concurs to rendezvous with this object for closer inspection
6
to carry out a survey of jupiter and its satellites as far as this is compatible with the above objectives
it is realized that unforeseen circumstances may require a change of priorities or even make it impossible to achieve some of these objectives
it must be clearly understood that the rendezvous with spacecraft discovery is for the express purpose of obtaining information about the artifact this must take precedence over all other objectives including attempts at salvage
crew the crew of spacecraft alexei leonov will consist of captain tatiana orlova engineering propulsion dr vasili orlov navigation astronomy dr maxim brailovsky engineering structures dr alexander kovalev engineering communications dr nikolai ternovsky engineering control systems surgeon commander katerina rudenko medical life support dr irma yakunina medical nutrition in addition the us national council on astronautics will provide the following three experts dr heywood floyd dropped the memorandum and leaned back in his chair
it was all settled the point of no return had been passed
even if he wished to do so there was no way to put back the clock
he glanced across at caroline sitting with two year old chris on the edge of the pool
the boy was more at home in the water than on land and could stay submerged for periods that often terrified visitors
and though he could not yet speak much human he already seemed fluent in dolphin
one of christopher s friends had just swum in from the pacific and was presenting his back to be patted
you too are a wanderer thought floyd in a vast and trackless ocean but how small your tiny pacific seems against the immensity i am facing now
caroline became aware of his gaze and rose to her feet
she looked at him sombrely but without anger all that had been burned out in the last few days
as she approached she even managed a wistful smile
i ve found that poem i was looking for she said
it starts like this what is a woman that you forsake her and the hearth fire and the home acre to go with the old grey widow maker sorry i don t quite understand
who is the widow maker not who what
the sea
the poem s a lament by a viking woman
it was written by rudyard kipling a hundred years ago floyd took his wife s hand she did not respond but neither did she resist
well i don t feel at all like a viking
i m not after loot and adventure is the very last thing i want then why no i don t intend to start another fight
but it would help us both if you know exactly what your motives are i wish i could give you one single good reason
instead i ve a whole host of little ones
but they add up to a final answer i can t argue with believe me i believe you
but are you sure you re not fooling yourself if i am then so are a lot of other people
including may i remind you the president of the united states i m not likely to forget
but suppose just suppose that he hadn t asked you
would you have volunteered i can answer that truthfully no
it would never have occurred to me
president mordecai s call was the biggest shock of my life
but when i thought it over i realized he was perfectly right
you know i don t go in for false modesty
i am the best qualified man for the job when the space docs give their final okay
and you should know that i m still in pretty good shape that brought the smile he had intended
sometimes i wonder if you d suggested it yourself the thought had indeed occurred to him but he could answer honestly
i would never have done so without consulting you i m glad you didn t
i don t know what i d have said i could still turn it down now you re talking nonsense and you know it
even if you did you d hate me for the rest of your life and you d never forgive yourself
you have too strong a sense of duty
maybe that s one of the reasons i married you duty
yes that was the key word and what multitudes it contained
he had a duty to himself to his family to the university to his past job even though he had left it under a cloud to his country and to the human race
it was not easy to establish the priorities and sometimes they conflicted with one another
there were perfectly logical reasons why he should go on the mission and equally logical reasons as many of his colleagues had already pointed out why he should not
but perhaps in the final analysis the choice had been made by his heart not his brain
and even here emotion urged him in two opposite directions
curiosity guilt the determination to finish a job that had been badly botched they all combined to drive him toward jupiter and whatever might be waiting there
on the other hand fear he was honest enough to admit that united with love of his family to keep him on earth
yet he had never had any real doubts he had made his decision almost instantly and had deflected all of caroline s arguments as gently as he could
and there was one other consoling thought that he had not yet risked sharing with his wife
though he would be gone two and a half years all but the fifty days at jupiter would be spent in timeless hibernation
when he returned the gap between their ages would have narrowed by more than two years
he would have sacrificed the present so that they could share a longer future together
5 leonov the months contracted to weeks the weeks dwindled to days the days shrivelled to hours and suddenly heywood floyd was once more at the cape spaceward bound for the first time since that trip to clavius base and the tycho monolith so many years ago
but this time he was not alone and there was no secrecy about the mission
a few seats ahead of him rode dr chandra already engaged in a dialogue with his briefcase computer and quite oblivious to his surroundings
one of floyd s secret amusements which he had never confided to anyone was spotting similarities between human beings and animals
the resemblances were more often flattering than insulting and his little hobby was also a very useful aid to memory
dr chandra was easy the adjective birdlike sprang instantly to mind
he was tiny delicate and all his movements were swift and precise
but which bird
obviously a very intelligent one
magpie
too perky and acquisitive
owl
no too slow moving
perhaps sparrow would do nicely
walter curnow the systems specialist who would have the formidable job of getting discovery operational again was a more difficult matter
he was a large husky man certainly not at all birdlike
one could usually find a match somewhere in the vast spectrum of dogs but no canine seemed to fit
of course curnow was a bear
not the sulky dangerous kind but the friendly good natured type
and perhaps this was appropriate it reminded floyd of the russian colleagues he would soon be joining
they had been up in orbit for days engaged in their final checks
this is the great moment of my life floyd told himself
now i am leaving on a mission that may determine the future of the human race
but he did not feel any sense of exultation all he could think of during the last minutes of the countdown were the words he had whispered just before he had left home goodbye my dear little son will you remember me when i return and he still felt resentment toward caroline because she would not awaken the sleeping child for one final embrace yet he knew that she had been wise and it was better that way
his mood was shattered by a sudden explosive laugh dr curnow was sharing a joke with his companions as well as a large bottle that he handled as delicately as a barely subcritical mass of plutonium
hey heywood he called they tell me captain orlova s locked up all the drinks so this is your last chance
ch teau thierry 95
sorry about the plastic cups as floyd sipped at the really superb champagne he found himself cringing mentally at the thought of curnow s guffaw reverberating all the way across the solar system
much as he admired the engineer s ability as a travelling companion curnow might prove something of a strain
at least dr chandra would not present such problems floyd could hardly imagine him smiling let alone laughing
and of course he turned down the champagne with a barely perceptible shudder
curnow was polite enough or glad enough not to insist
the engineer was it seemed determined to be the life and soul of the party
a few minutes later he produced a two octave electronic keyboard and gave rapid renderings of d ye ken john peel as performed successively by piano trombone violin flute and full organ with vocal accompaniment
he was really very good and floyd soon found himself singing along with the others
but it was just as well he thought that curnow would spend most of the voyage in silent hibernation
the music died with a sudden despairing discord as the engines ignited and the shuttle launched itself into the sky
floyd was gripped by a familiar but always new exhilaration the sense of boundless power carrying him up and away from the cares and duties of earth
men knew better than they realized when they placed the abode of the gods beyond the reach of gravity
he was flying toward that realm of weightlessness for the moment he would ignore the fact that out there lay not freedom but the greatest responsibility of his career
as the thrust increased he felt the weight of worlds upon his shoulders but he welcomed it like an atlas who had not yet tired of his burden
he did not attempt to think but was content to savour the experience
even if he was leaving earth for the last time and saying farewell to all that he had ever loved he felt no sadness
the roar that surrounded him was a paean of triumph sweeping away all minor emotions
he was almost sorry when it ceased though he welcomed the easier breathing and the sudden sense of freedom
most of the other passengers started to unbuckle their safety straps preparing to enjoy the thirty minutes of zero gravity during the transfer orbit but a few who were obviously making the trip for the first time remained in their seats looking around anxiously for the cabin attendants
captain speaking
we re now at an altitude of three hundred kilometres coming up over the west coast of africa
you won t see much as it s night down there that glow ahead is sierra leone and there s a big tropical storm over the gulf of guinea
look at those flashes
we ll have sunrise in fifteen minutes
meanwhile i m rolling the ship so you can get a good view of the equatorial satellite belt
the brightest one almost straight overhead is intelsat s atlantic 1 antenna farm
then intercosmos 2 to the west that fainter star is jupiter
and if you look just below that you ll see a flashing light moving against the star background that s the new chinese space station
we pass within a hundred kilometres not close enough to see anything with the naked eye what were they up to
floyd thought idly
he had examined the close ups of the squat cylindrical structure with its curious bulges and saw no reason to believe the alarmist rumours that it was a laser equipped fortress
but while the beijing academy of science ignored the un space committee s repeated requests for a tour of inspection the chinese only had themselves to blame for such hostile propaganda
the cosmonaut alexei leonov was not a thing of beauty but few spacecraft ever were
one day perhaps the human race would develop a new aesthetic generations of artists might arise whose ideals were not based upon the natural forms of earth moulded by wind and water
space itself was a realm of often overpowering beauty unfortunately man s hardware did not yet live up to it
apart from the four huge propellant tanks which would be dropped off as soon as the transfer orbit was achieved leonov was surprisingly small
from heat shield to drive units was less than fifty metres it was hard to believe that so modest a vehicle smaller than many commercial aircraft could carry ten men and women halfway across the solar system
but zero gravity which made walls and roof and floor interchangeable rewrote all the rules of living
there was plenty of room aboard leonov even when everyone was awake at the same time as was certainly the case at the moment
indeed her normal complement was at least doubled by assorted newsmen engineers making final adjustments and anxious officials
as soon as the shuttle had docked floyd tried to find the cabin he would share a year hence when he awoke with curnow and chandra
when he did locate it he discovered that it was packed so tightly with neatly labelled boxes of equipment and provisions that entry was almost impossible
he was wondering glumly how to get a foot in the door when one of the crew launching himself skilfully from handhold to handhold noticed floyd s dilemma and braked to a halt
dr floyd welcome aboard
i m max brailovsky assistant engineer the young russian spoke the slow careful english of a student who had had more lessons with an electronic tutor than a human teacher
as they shook hands floyd matched the face and name to the set of crew biographies he had already studied maxim andreievitch brailovsky age thirty one born leningrad specializing in structure hobbies fencing skycycling chess
glad to meet you said floyd
but how do i get inside not to worry said max cheerfully
all that will be gone when you wake up
it s what do you say
expendables
we ll eat your room empty by the time you need it
i promise he patted his stomach
fine but meanwhile where do i put my things floyd pointed to the three small cases total mass fifty kilograms which contained he hoped everything he needed for the next couple of billion kilometres
it had been no easy task shepherding their weightless but not inertialess bulk through the ship s corridors with only a few collisions
max took two of the bags glided gently through the triangle formed by three intersecting girders and dived into a small hatchway apparently defying newton s first law in the process
floyd acquired a few extra bruises while following him after a considerable time leonov seemed much bigger inside than out they arrived at a door labelled captain in both cyrillic and roman
although he could read russian much better than he could speak it floyd appreciated the gesture he had already noticed that all ship s notices were bilingual
at max s knock a green light flashed on and floyd drifted inside as gracefully as he could
though he had spoken to captain orlova many times they had never before met
so he had two surprises
it was impossible to judge a person s real size over the viewphone the camera somehow converted everyone to the same scale
captain orlova standing as well as one could stand in zero gravity barely reached to floyd s shoulders
the viewphone had also completely failed to convey the penetrating quality of those dazzling blue eyes much the most striking feature of a face that at the moment could not be fairly judged for beauty
hello tanya said floyd
how nice to meet at last
but what a pity about your hair they grasped both hands like old friends
and nice to have you aboard heywood answered the captain
her english unlike brailovsky s was quite fluent though heavily accented
yes i was sorry to lose it but hair s a nuisance on long missions and i like to keep the local barbers away as long as possible
and my apologies about your cabin as max will have explained we suddenly found we needed another ten cubic metres of storage space
vasili and i won t be spending much time here for the next few hours please feel free to use our quarters thank you
what about curnow and chandra i ve made similar arrangements with the crew
it may seem as if we re treating you like cargo not wanted on voyage pardon that s a label they used to put on the baggage in the old days of ocean travel tanya smiled
it does look rather that way
but you ll be wanted all right at the end of the trip
we re already planning your revival party that sounds too religious
make it no resurrection would be even worse
waking up party
but i can see how busy you are let me dump my things and continue my grand tour max will show you around take dr floyd to vasili will you
he s down in the drive unit as they drifted out of the captain s quarters floyd gave mental good marks to the crew selection committee
tanya orlova was impressive enough on paper in the flesh she was almost intimidating despite her charm
i wonder what she s like floyd asked himself when she loses her temper
would it be fire or ice
on the whole i d prefer not to find out
floyd was rapidly acquiring his space legs by the time they reached vasili orlov he was manoeuvring almost as confidently as his guide
the chief scientist greeted floyd as warmly as his wife had
welcome aboard heywood
how do you feel fine apart from slowly starving to death for a moment orlov looked puzzled then his face split into a broad smile oh i d forgotten
well it won t be for long
in ten months time you can eat as much as you like hibernators went on a low residue diet a week in advance for the last twenty four hours they took nothing but liquid
floyd was beginning to wonder how much of his increasing light headedness was due to starvation how much to curnow s champagne and how much to zero gravity
to concentrate his mind he scanned the multicoloured mass of plumbing that surrounded them
so this is the famous sakharov drive
it s the first time i ve seen a full scale unit it s only the fourth one ever built i hope it works it had better
otherwise the gorky city council will be renaming sakharov square again it was a sign of the times that a russian could joke however wryly about his country s treatment of its greatest scientist
floyd was again reminded of sakharov s eloquent speech to the academy when he was belatedly made hero of the soviet union
prison and banishment he had told his listeners were splendid aids to creativity not a few masterpieces had been born within the walls of cells beyond the reach of the world s distractions
for that matter the greatest single achievement of the human intellect the principia itself was a product of newton s self imposed exile from plague ridden london
the comparison was not immodest from those years in gorky had come not only new insights into the structure of matter and the origin of the universe but the plasma controlling concepts that had led to practical thermonuclear power
the drive itself though the best known and most publicized outcome of that work was merely one byproduct of that astonishing intellectual outburst
the tragedy was that such advances had been triggered by injustice one day perhaps humanity would find more civilized ways of managing its affairs
by the time they had left the chamber floyd had learned more about the sakharov drive than he really wished to know or expected to remember
he was well acquainted with its basic principles the use of a pulsed thermonuclear reaction to heat and expel virtually any propellant material
the best results were obtained with pure hydrogen as a working fluid but that was excessively bulky and difficult to store over long periods of time
methane and ammonia were acceptable alternatives even water could be used though with considerably poorer efficiency
leonov would compromise the enormous liquid hydrogen tanks that provided the initial impetus would be discarded when the ship had attained the necessary speed to carry it to jupiter
at the destination ammonia would be used for the braking and rendezvous manoeuvres and the eventual return to earth
that was the theory checked and rechecked in endless tests and computer simulations
but as the ill fated discovery had shown so well all human plans were subject to ruthless revision by nature or fate or whatever one preferred to call the powers behind the universe
so there you are dr floyd said an authoritative female voice interrupting vasili s enthusiastic explanation of magnetohydrodynamic feedback why didn t you report to me floyd rotated slowly on his axis by gently torquing himself with one hand
he saw a massive maternal figure wearing a curious uniform adorned with dozens of pockets and pouches the effect was not unlike that of a cossack trooper draped with cartridge belts
nice to meet you again doctor
i m still exploring i hope you ve received my medical report from houston those vets at teague
i wouldn t trust them to recognize foot and mouth disease floyd knew perfectly well the mutual respect felt between katerina rudenko and the olin teague medical center even if the doctor s broad grin had not discounted her words
she saw his look of frank curiosity and proudly fingered the webbing around her ample waist
the conventional little black bag isn t very practical in zero gravity things float out of it and aren t there when you need them
i designed this myself it s a complete minisurgery
with this i could remove an appendix or deliver a baby i trust that particular problem won t arise here ha
a good doctor has to be ready for everything what a contrast thought floyd between captain orlova and dr or should he call her by her correct rank of surgeon commander
rudenko
the captain had the grace and intensity of a prima ballerina the doctor might have been the prototype of mother russia stocky build flat peasant face needing only a shawl to complete the picture
don t let that fool you floyd told himself
this is the woman who saved at least a dozen lives during the komarov docking accident and in her spare time manages to edit the annals of space medicine
consider yourself very lucky to have her aboard
now dr floyd you re going to have plenty of time later to explore our little ship
my colleagues are too polite to say this but they ve work to do and you re in the way
i d like to get you all three of you nice and peaceful as quickly as we can
then we ll have less to worry about i was afraid of that but i quite see your point of view
i m ready as soon as you are i m always ready
come along please the ship s hospital was just large enough to hold an operating table two exercise bicycles a few cabinets of equipment and an x ray machine
while dr rudenko was giving floyd a quick but thorough examination she asked unexpectedly what s that little gold cylinder dr chandra carries on the chain around his neck some kind of communications device
he wouldn t take it off in fact he was almost too shy to take anything off floyd could not help smiling it was easy to imagine the modest indian s reactions to this rather overwhelming lady
it s a lingam a what you re the doctor you ought to recognize it
the symbol of male fertility of course stupid of me
is he a practising hindu
it s a little late to ask us to arrange a strict vegetarian diet don t worry we wouldn t have done that to you without fair warning
though he won t touch alcohol chandra s not fanatical about anything except computers
he once told me that his grandfather was a priest in benares and gave him that lingam it s been in the family for generations rather to floyd s surprise dr rudenko did not show the negative reaction he had expected indeed her expression became uncharacteristically wistful
i understand his feeling
my grandmother gave me a beautiful icon sixteenth century
i wanted to bring it but it weighs five kilos the doctor became abruptly businesslike again gave floyd a painless injection with a gas gun hypodermic and told him to come back as soon as he was sleepy
that she assured him would be in less than two hours
meanwhile relax completely she ordered
there s an observation port on this level station d 6
why don t you go there it seemed a good idea and floyd drifted away with a docility that would have surprised his friends
dr rudenko glanced at her watch dictated a brief entry into her autosec and set its alarm thirty minutes ahead
when he reached the d 6 viewport floyd found chandra and curnow already there
they looked at him with a total lack of recognition then turned once more toward the awesome spectacle outside
it occurred to floyd and he congratulated himself on such a brilliant observation that chandra could not really be enjoying the view
his eyes were tightly closed a totally unfamiliar planet hung there gleaming with glorious blues and dazzling whites
how strange floyd told himself
what has happened to the earth
why of course no wonder he didn t recognize it
it was upside down
what a disaster he wept briefly for all those poor people falling off into space
he barely noticed when two crew members removed chandra s unresisting form
when they came back for curnow floyd s own eyes were shut but he was still breathing
when they returned for him even his breathing had ceased
ii tsien 6 awakening and they told us we wouldn t dream thought heywood floyd more with surprise than annoyance
the glorious pink glow that surrounded him was very soothing it reminded him of barbecues and the crackling logs of christmas fire
but there was no warmth indeed he felt a distinct though not uncomfortable coldness
voices were murmuring just too softly for him to understand the words
they became louder but still he could not understand
surely he said in sudden amazement i can t be dreaming in russian no heywood answered a woman s voice
you re not dreaming
it s time to get out of bed the lovely glow faded he opened his eyes and had a blurred glimpse of a flashlight being withdrawn from his face
he was lying on a couch held against it by elastic webbing figures were standing around him but they were too out of focus to identify
gentle fingers closed his eyelids and massaged his forehead
don t exert yourself
breathe deeply again that s right now how do you feel i don t know strange light headed and hungry that s a good sign
do you know where you are
you can open your eyes now the figures came into focus first dr rudenko then captain orlova
but something had happened to tanya since he had seen her only an hour ago
when floyd identified the cause it was almost a physical shock
you ve grown your hair back i hope you think it s an improvement
i can t say the same about your beard floyd lifted his hand to his face finding that he had to make a conscious effort to plan every stage of the movement
his chin was covered with short stubble a two or three days growth
in hibernation hair grew at only a hundredth of its normal rate
so i made it he said
we ve arrived at jupiter tanya looked at him sombrely then glanced at the doctor who gave a barely perceptible nod
no heywood she said
we re still a month away
don t be alarmed the ship s fine and everything s running normally
but your friends in washington have asked us to wake you up ahead of time
something very unexpected has happened
we re in a race to reach discovery and i m afraid we re going to lose 7 tsien when heywood floyd s voice came from the comset speaker the two dolphins suddenly stopped circling around the pool and swam over to its edge
they placed their heads on the rim and stared intently at the source of the sound
so they recognize heywood thought caroline with a twinge of bitterness yet christopher crawling around his playpen did not even stop playing with the colour controls of his picture book as his father s voice came loud and clear across half a billion kilometres of space
my dear you won t be surprised to hear from me a month ahead of schedule you ll have known for weeks that we have company out here
i still find it hard to believe in some ways it doesn t even make sense
they can t possibly have enough fuel for a safe return to earth we don t even see how they can make the rendezvous
we never saw them of course
even at its closest tsien was more than fifty million kilometres away
they had plenty of time to answer our signals if they wanted to but they ignored us completely
now they ll be much too busy for friendly chat
in a few hours they ll hit jupiter s atmosphere and then we ll see how well their aerobraking system works
if it does its job that will be good for our morale
but if it fails well let s not talk about that
the russians are taking it remarkably well all things considered
they re angry and disappointed of course but i ve heard many expressions of frank admiration
it was certainly a brilliant trick building that ship in full view and making everyone think it was a spacestation until they hitched on those boosters
well there s nothing we can do except watch
and at our distance we won t have a much better view than your best telescopes
i can t help wishing them luck though of course i hope they leave discovery alone
that s our property and i bet the state department s reminding them of it every hour on the hour
it s an ill wind if our chinese friends hadn t jumped the gun on us you wouldn t have heard from me for another month
but now that dr rudenko s woken me up i ll be speaking to you every couple of days
after the initial shock i m settling down nicely getting to know the ship and its crew finding my space legs
and polishing up my lousy russian though i don t have much chance of using it everyone insists on speaking english
what shocking linguists we americans are
i sometimes feel ashamed of our chauvinism or our laziness
the standard of on board english ranges from absolutely perfect chief engineer sasha kovalev could earn a living as a bbc announcer down to the if you talk fast enough it doesn t matter how many mistakes you make variety
the only one who isn t fluent is zenia marchenko who replaced irma yakunina at the last moment
incidentally i m glad to hear that irma made a good recovery what a disappointment that must have been
i wonder if she s started hang gliding again
and speaking of accidents it s obvious that zenia must also have had a very bad one
though the plastic surgeons have done a remarkable job you can tell that she must have been severely burned at some time
she s the baby of the crew and the others treat her with i was going to say pity but that s too condescending
let s say with special kindness
maybe you re wondering how i get on with captain tanya
well i like her very much but i d hate to make her angry
there s no doubt exactly who runs this ship
and surgeon commander rudenko you met her at the honolulu aerospace convention two years ago and i m sure you won t have forgotten that last party
you ll understand why we all call her catherine the great behind her broad back of course
but that s enough gossip
if i run overtime i hate to think of the surcharge
and by the way these personal calls are supposed to be completely private
but there are a lot of links in the communications chain so don t be surprised if you occasionally get messages by well another route
i ll be waiting to hear from you tell the girls i ll be speaking to them later
my love to you all i miss you and chris very badly
and when i get back i promise i ll never leave again there was a brief hissing pause then an obviously synthetic voice said this terminates transmission four hundred thirty two stroke seven from spacecraft leonov as caroline floyd switched off the speaker the two dolphins slid beneath the surface of the pool and glided out into the pacific leaving scarcely a ripple in the water
when he realized that his friends were gone christopher began to cry
his mother picked him up in her arms and tried to comfort him but it was a long time before she succeeded
8 transit of jupiter the image of jupiter with its ribbons of white cloud its mottled bands of salmon pink and the great red spot staring out like a baleful eye hung steady on the flight deck projection screen
it was three quarters full but no one was looking at the illuminated disk all eyes were focused on the crescent of darkness at its edge
there over the nightside of the planet the chinese ship was about to meet its moment of truth
this is absurd thought floyd
we can t possibly see anything across forty million kilometres
and it doesn t matter the radio will tell us all we want to know
tsien had closed down all voice video and data circuits two hours before as the long range antennas were withdrawn into the protective shadow of the heat shield
only the omnidirectional beacon was still transmitting accurately pinpointing the chinese ship s position as it plunged toward that ocean of continent sized clouds
the shrill beep beep beep was the only sound in leonov s control room
each of those pulses had left jupiter more than two minutes earlier by this time their source might already be a cloud of incandescent gas dispersing in the jovian stratosphere
the signal was fading becoming noisy
the beeps were getting distorted several dropped out completely then the sequence returned
a plasma sheath was building up around tsien and soon would cut off all communications until the ship re emerged
if it ever did
posmotri cried max
there it is at first floyd could see nothing
then just off the edge of the illuminated disk he made out a tiny star gleaming where no star could possibly be against the darkened face of jupiter
it appeared quite motionless though he knew it must be moving at a hundred kilometres a second
slowly it grew in brilliance and then it was no longer a dimensionless point but was becoming elongated
a man made comet was streaking across the jovian night sky leaving a trail of incandescence thousands of kilometres in length
one last badly distorted and curiously drawn out beep sounded from the tracking beacon then only the meaningless hiss of jupiter s own radiation one of those many cosmic voices that had nothing to do with man or his works
tsien was inaudible but not yet invisible
for they could see that the tiny elongated spark had indeed moved appreciably away from the sunward face of the planet and would soon disappear into the nightside
by then if all had gone according to plan jupiter would have captured the ship destroying its unwanted velocity
when it emerged from behind the giant world it would be another jovian satellite
the spark flickered out
tsien had rounded the curve of the planet and was heading over the nightside
there would be nothing to see or to hear until it emerged from shadow if all went well in just under an hour
it would be a very long hour for the chinese
to chief scientist vasili orlov and communications engineer sasha kovalev the hour went extremely quickly
there was much they could learn from observations of that little star its times of appearance and disappearance and above all the doppler shift of the radio beacon gave vital information about tsien s new orbit
leonov s computers were already digesting the figures and spitting out projected times of re emergence based on various assumptions about rates of deceleration in the jovian atmosphere
vasili switched off the computer display spun around in his chair loosened his seat belt and addressed the patiently waiting audience
earliest reappearance is in forty two minutes
why don t you spectators go for a walk so we can concentrate on getting all this into good shape
see you in thirty five minutes
shoo
nu ukhodi reluctantly the unwanted bodies left the bridge but to vasili s disgust everyone was back again in little more than thirty minutes
he was still chiding them for their lack of faith in his calculations when the familiar beep beep beep of tsien s tracking beacon burst from the loudspeakers
vasili looked astonished and mortified but soon joined in the spontaneous round of applause floyd could not see who first started the clapping
rivals though they might be they were all astronauts together as far from home as any men had ever travelled ambassadors for mankind in the noble words of the first un space treaty
even if they did not want the chinese to succeed neither did they wish them to meet disaster
a large element of self interest was also involved floyd could not help thinking
now the odds in leonov s own favour were significantly improved tsien had demonstrated that the aerobraking manoeuvre was indeed possible
the data on jupiter was correct its atmosphere did not contain unexpected and perhaps fatal surprises
well said tanya
i suppose we should send them a message of congratulations
but even if we did they wouldn t acknowledge it some of his colleagues were still making fun of vasili who was staring at his computer output in frank disbelief
i don t understand it he exclaimed
they should still be behind jupiter
sasha give me a velocity reading on their beacon another silent dialogue was held with the computer then vasili gave a long low whistle
something s wrong
they re in a capture orbit all right but it won t let them make a rendezvous with discovery
the orbit they re on now will take them way beyond io i ll have more accurate data when we ve tracked them for another five minutes anyway they must be in a safe orbit said tanya
they can always make corrections later perhaps
but that could cost them days even if they have the fuel
which i doubt so we may still beat them don t be such an optimist
we re still three weeks from jupiter
they can make a dozen orbits before we get there and choose the most favourable one for a rendezvous again assuming that they have enough propellant of course
and that s something we can only make educated guesses about all this conversation took place in such rapid and excited russian that floyd was left far behind
when tanya took pity on him and explained that tsien had overshot and was heading for the outer satellites his first reaction was then they may be in serious trouble
what will you do if they appeal for help you must be making a joke
can you imagine them doing that
they re much too proud
anyway it would be impossible
we can t change our mission profile as you know perfectly well
even if we had the fuel you re right of course but it might be difficult to explain that to the ninety nine per cent of the human race that doesn t understand orbital mechanics
we should start thinking about some of the political complications it would look bad for all of us if we can t help
vasili will you give me their final orbit as soon as you ve worked it out
i m going down to my cabin to do some homework floyd s cabin or rather one third of a cabin was still partly full of stores many of them stacked in the curtained bunks that would be occupied by chandra and curnow when they emerged from their long slumbers
he had managed to clear a small working space for his personal effects and had been promised the luxury of another whole two cubic metres just as soon as someone could be spared to help with the furniture removing
floyd unlocked his little communications console set the decryption keys and called for the information on tsien that had been transmitted to him from washington
he wondered if his hosts had had any luck in unscrambling it the cipher was based on the product of two hundred digit prime numbers and the national security agency had staked its reputation on the claim that the fastest computer in existence could not crack it before the big crunch at the end of the universe
it was a claim that could never be proved only disproved
once again he stared intently at the excellent photographs of the chinese ship taken when it had revealed its true colours and was just about to leave earth orbit
there were later shots not so clear because by then it had been far away from the prying cameras of the final stage as it hurtled toward jupiter
those were the ones that interested him most even more useful were the cutaway drawings and estimates of performance
granted the most optimistic assumptions it was difficult to see what the chinese hoped to do
they must have burned up at least ninety per cent of their propellant in that mad dash across the solar system
unless it was literally a suicide mission something that could not be ruled out only a plan involving hibernation and later rescue made any sense
and intelligence did not believe that chinese hibernation technology was sufficiently far advanced to make that a viable option
but intelligence was frequently wrong and even more often confused by the avalanche of raw facts it had to evaluate the noise in its information circuits
it had done a remarkable job on tsien considering the shortness of time but floyd wished that the material sent to him had been more carefully filtered
some of it was obvious junk of no possible connection with the mission
nevertheless when you did not know what you were looking for it was important to avoid all prejudices and preconceptions something that at first sight seemed irrelevant or even nonsensical might turn out to be a vital clue
with a sigh floyd started once more to skim the five hundred pages of data keeping his mind as blankly receptive as possible while diagrams charts photographs some so smudgy that they could represent almost anything news items lists of delegates to scientific conferences titles of technical publications and even commercial documents scrolled swiftly down the high resolution screen
a very efficient industrial espionage system had obviously been extremely busy who would have thought that so many japanese holomemory modules or swiss gas flow microcontrollers or german radiation detectors could have been traced to a destination in the dried lake bed of lop nor the first milepost on their way to jupiter
some of the items must have been included by accident they could not possibly relate to the mission
if the chinese had placed a secret order for one thousand infrared sensors through a dummy corporation in singapore that was only the concern of the military it seemed highly unlikely that tsien expected to be chased by heat seeking missiles
and this one was really funny specialized surveying and prospecting equipment from glacier geophysics inc of anchorage alaska
what lamebrain imagined that a deep space expedition would have any need the smile froze on floyd s lips he felt the skin crawl on the back of his neck
my god they wouldn t dare
but they had already dared greatly and now at last everything made sense
he flashed back to the photos and conjectured plans of the chinese ship
yes it was just conceivable those flutings at the rear alongside the drive deflection electrodes would be about the right size
floyd called the bridge
vasili he said have you worked out their orbit yet yes i have the navigator replied in a curiously subdued voice
floyd could tell at once that something had turned up
he took a long shot
they re making a rendezvous with europa aren t they there was an explosive gasp of disbelief from the other end
chyort voz mi
how did you know i didn t i ve just guessed it there can t be any mistake i ve checked the figures to six places
the braking manoeuvre worked out exactly as they intended
they re right on course for europa it couldn t have happened by chance
they ll be there in seventeen hours and go into orbit perhaps it wouldn t take much propellant
but what would be the point i ll risk another guess
they ll do a quick survey and then they ll land you re crazy or do you know something we don t no it s just a matter of simple deduction
you re going to start kicking yourself for missing the obvious okay sherlock why should anyone want to land on europa
what s there for heaven s sake floyd was enjoying his little moment of triumph
of course he might still be completely wrong
what s on europa
only the most valuable substance in the universe he had overdone it vasili was no fool and snatched the answer from his lips
of course water exactly
billions and billions of tons of it
enough to fill up the propellant tanks go cruising around all the satellites and still have plenty left for the rendezvous with discovery and the voyage home
i hate to say this vasili but our chinese friends have outsmarted us again
always assuming of course that they can get away with it 9 the ice of the grand canal apart from the jet black sky the photo might have been taken almost anywhere in the polar regions of earth there was nothing in the least alien about the sea of wrinkled ice that stretched all the way out to the horizon
only the five spacesuited figures in the foreground proclaimed that the panorama was of another world
even now the secretive chinese had not released the names of the crew
the anonymous intruders on the frozen europan icescape were merely the chief scientist the commander the navigator the first engineer the second engineer
it was also ironic floyd could not help thinking that everyone on earth had seen the already historic photograph an hour before it reached leonov so much closer to the scene
but tsien s transmissions were relayed on such a tight beam that it was impossible to intercept them leonov could receive only its beacon broadcasting impartially in all directions
even that was inaudible more than half the time as europa s rotation carried it out of sight or the satellite itself was eclipsed by the monstrous bulk of jupiter
all the scanty news of the chinese mission had to be relayed from earth
the ship had touched down after its initial survey on one of the few islands of solid rock that protruded through the crust of ice covering virtually the entire moon
that ice was flat from pole to pole there was no weather to carve it into strange shapes no drifting snow to build up layer upon layer into slowly moving hills
meteorites might fall upon airless europa but never a flake of snow
the only forces moulding its surface were the steady tug of gravity reducing all elevations to one uniform level and the incessant quakes caused by the other satellites as they passed and repassed europa in their orbits
jupiter itself despite its far greater mass had much less effect
the jovian tides had finished their work aeons ago ensuring that europa remained locked forever with one face turned toward its giant master
all this had been known since the voyager flyby missions of the 197 s the galileo surveys of the 198 s and the kepler landings of the 199 s
but in a few hours the chinese had learned more about europa than all the previous missions combined
that knowledge they were keeping to themselves one might regret it but few would deny that they had earned the right to do so
what was being denied with greater and greater asperity was their right to annex the satellite
for the first time in history a nation had laid claim to another world and all the news media of earth were arguing over the legal position
though the chinese pointed out at tedious length that they had never signed the 2 un space treaty and so were not bound by its provisions that did nothing to quell the angry protests
suddenly europa was the biggest news in the solar system
and the man on the spot at least to the nearest few million kilometres was in great demand
this is heywood floyd aboard cosmonaut alexei leonov on course for jupiter
but as you can well imagine all our thoughts are now focused upon europa
at this very moment i m looking at it through the most powerful of the ship s telescopes under this magnification it s ten times larger than the moon as you see it with the naked eye
and it s a really weird sight
the surface is a uniform pink with a few small brown patches
it s covered with an intricate network of narrow lines curling and weaving in all directions
in fact it looks very much like a photo from a medical textbook showing a pattern of veins and arteries
a few of these features are hundreds or even thousands of kilometres long and look rather like the illusory canals that percival lowell and other early twentieth century astronomers imagined they d seen on mars
but europa s canals aren t an illusion though of course they re not artificial
what s more they do contain water or at least ice
for the satellite is almost entirely covered by ocean averaging fifty kilometres deep
because it s so far from the sun europa s surface temperature is extremely low about a hundred and fifty degrees below freezing
so one might expect its single ocean to be a solid block of ice
surprisingly that isn t the case because there s a lot of heat generated inside europa by tidal forces the same forces that drive the great volcanoes on neighbouring io
so the ice is continually melting breaking up and freezing forming cracks and lanes like those in the floating ice sheets in our own polar regions
it s that intricate tracery of cracks i m seeing now most of them are dark and very ancient perhaps millions of years old
but a few are almost pure white they re the new ones that have just opened up and have a crust only a few centimetres thick
tsien has landed right beside one of these white streaks the fifteen hundred kilometre long feature that s been christened the grand canal
presumably the chinese intend to pump its water into their propellant tanks so that they can explore the jovian satellite system and then return to earth
that may not be easy but they ll certainly have studied the landing site with great care and must know what they re doing
it s obvious now why they ve taken such a risk and why they should claim europa
as a refuelling point it could be the key to the entire outer solar system
though there s also water on ganymede it s all frozen and also less accessible because of that satellite s more powerful gravity
and there s another point that s just occurred to me
even if the chinese do get stranded on europa they might be able to survive until a rescue mission is arranged
they have plenty of power there may be useful minerals in the area and we know that the chinese are the experts on synthetic food production
it wouldn t be a very luxurious life but i have some friends who would accept it happily for that staggering view of jupiter sprawled across the sky the view we expect to see ourselves in just a few days
this is heywood floyd saying goodbye for my colleagues and myself aboard alexei leonov and this is the bridge
very nice presentation heywood
you should have been a newsman i ve had plenty of practice
half my time was spent on pr work pr public relations usually telling politicians why they should give me more money
something you don t have to bother about how i wish that was true
anyway come up to the bridge
there s some new information we d like to discuss with you floyd removed his button microphone locked the telescope into position and extricated himself from the tiny viewing blister
as he left he almost collided with nikolai temovsky obviously on a similar mission
i m about to steal your best quotes for radio moscow woody
hope you don t mind you re welcome tovarishch
anyway how could i stop you up on the bridge captain orlova was looking thoughtfully at a dense mass of words and figures on the main display
floyd had painfully started to transliterate them when she interrupted him
don t worry about the details
these are estimates of the time it will take for tsien to refill its tanks and get ready for lift off my people are doing the same calculations but there are far too many variables we think we ve removed one of them
did you know that the very best water pumps you can buy belong to fire brigades
and would you be surprised to learn that the beijing central station had four of its latest models suddenly requisitioned a few months ago despite the protests of the mayor i m not surprised merely lost in admiration
go on please that may be a coincidence but those pumps would be just the right size
making educated guesses about pipe deployment drilling through the ice and so on well we think they could lift off again in five days five days if they re lucky and everything works perfectly
and if they don t wait to fill their propellant tanks but merely take on just enough for a safe rendezvous with discovery before we do
even if they beat us by a single hour that would be enough
they could claim salvage rights at the very least not according to the state department s lawyers
at the appropriate moment we ll declare that discovery is not a derelict but has merely been parked until we can retrieve it
any attempt to take over the ship would be an act of piracy i m sure the chinese will be most impressed if they re not what can we do about it we outnumber them and two to one when we revive chandra and curnow are you serious
where are the cutlasses for the boarding party cutlasses swords weapons oh
we could use the laser telespectrometer
that can vaporize milligram asteroid samples at ranges of a thousand kilometres i m not sure that i like this conversation
my government certainly would not condone violence except of course in self defence you naive americans
we re more realistic we have to be
all your grandparents died of old age heywood
three of mine were killed in the great patriotic war when they were alone together tanya always called him woody never heywood
she must be serious
or was she merely testing his reactions
anyway discovery is merely a few billion dollars worth of hardware
the ship s not important only the information it carries exactly
information that could be copied and then erased you do get some cheerful ideas tanya
sometimes i think that all russians are a little paranoiac thanks to napoleon and hitler we ve earned every right to be
but don t tell me that you haven t already worked out that what do you call it scenario
for yourself it wasn t necessary floyd answered rather glumly
the state department s already done it for me with variations
we ll just have to see which one the chinese come up with
and i wouldn t be in the least surprised if they outguess us again 1 a cry from europa sleeping in zero gravity is a skill that has to be learned it had taken floyd almost a week to find the best way of anchoring legs and arms so that they did not drift into uncomfortable positions
now he was an expert and was not looking forward to the return of weight indeed the very idea gave him occasional nightmares
someone was shaking him awake
no he must still be dreaming
privacy was sacred aboard a spaceship nobody ever entered another crew member s chambers without first asking permission
he clenched his eyes shut but the shaking continued
dr floyd please wake up
you re wanted on the flight deck and nobody called him dr floyd the most formal salutation he had received for weeks was doc
what was happening
reluctantly he opened his eyes
he was in his tiny cabin gently gripped by his sleeping cocoon
so one part of his mind told him then why was he looking at europa
they were still millions of kilometres away
there were the familiar reticulations the patterns of triangles and polygons formed by intersecting lines
and surely that was the grand canal itself no it wasn t quite right
how could it be since he was still in his little cabin aboard leonov
dr floyd he became fully awake and realized that his left hand was floating just a few centimetres in front of his eyes
how strange that the pattern of lines across the palm was so uncannily like the map of europa
but economical mother nature was always repeating herself on such vastly different scales as the swirl of milk stirred into coffee the cloud lanes of a cyclonic storm the arms of a spiral nebula
sorry max he said
what s the problem
is something wrong we think so but not with us
tsien s in trouble captain navigator and chief engineer were strapped in their seats on the flight deck the rest of the crew orbited anxiously around convenient handholds or watched on the monitors
sorry to wake you up heywood tanya apologized brusquely
here s the situation
ten minutes ago we had a class one priority from mission control
tsien s gone off the air
it happened very suddenly in the middle of a cipher message there were a few seconds of garbled transmission then nothing their beacon that s stopped as well
we can t receive it either phew
then it must be serious a major breakdown
any theories lots but all guesswork
an explosion landslide earthquake who knows and we may never know until someone else lands on europa or we do a close flyby and take a look tanya shook her head
we don t have enough delta vee
the closest we could get is fifty thousand kilometres
not much you could see from that distance then there s absolutely nothing we can do not quite heywood
mission control has a suggestion
they d like us to swing our big dish around just in case we can pick up any weak emergency transmissions
it s how do you say
a long shot but worth trying
what do you think floyd s first reaction was strongly negative
that will mean breaking our link with earth of course but we ll have to do that anyway when we go around jupiter
and it will only take a couple of minutes to re establish the circuit floyd remained silent
the suggestion was perfectly reasonable yet it worried him obscurely
after puzzling for several seconds he suddenly realized why he was so opposed to the idea
discovery s troubles had started when the big dish the main antenna complex had lost its lock on earth for reasons which even now were not completely clear
but hal had certainly been involved and there was no danger of a similar situation arising here
leonov s computers were small autonomous units there was no single controlling intelligence
at least no nonhuman one
the russians were still waiting patiently for his answer
i agree he said at last
let earth know what we re doing and start listening
i suppose you ll try all the space mayday frequencies yes as soon as we ve worked out the doppler corrections
how s it going sasha give me another two minutes and i ll have the automatic search running
how long should we listen the captain barely paused before giving her answer
floyd had often admired tanya orlova s decisiveness and had once told her so
in a rare flash of humour she had replied woody a commander can be wrong but never uncertain listen for fifty minutes and report back to earth for ten
then repeat the cycle there was nothing to see or hear the automatic circuits were better at sifting the radio noise than any human senses
nevertheless from time to time sasha turned up the audio monitor and the roar of jupiter s radiation belts filled the cabin
it was a sound like the waves breaking on all the beaches of earth with occasional explosive cracks from superbolts of lightning in the jovian atmosphere
of human signals there was no trace and one by one the members of the crew not on duty drifted quietly away
while he was waiting floyd did some mental calculations
whatever had happened to tsien was already two hours in the past since the news had been relayed from earth
but leonov should be able to pick up a direct message after less than a minute s delay so the chinese had already had ample time to get back on the air
their continued silence suggested some catastrophic failure and he found himself weaving endless scenarios of disaster
the fifty minutes seemed like hours
when they were up sasha swung the ship s antenna complex back toward earth and reported failure
while he was using the rest of the ten minutes to send a backlog of messages he looked inquiringly at the captain
is it worth trying again he said in a voice that clearly expressed his own pessimism
of course
we may cut back the search time but we ll keep listening on the hour the big dish was once more focused upon europa
and almost at once the automatic monitor started flashing its alert light
sasha s hand darted to the audio gain and the voice of jupiter filled the cabin
superimposed upon that like a whisper heard against a thunderstorm was the faint but completely unmistakable sound of human speech
it was impossible to identify the language though floyd felt certain from the intonation and rhythm that it was not chinese but some european tongue
sasha played skilfully with fine tuning and band width controls and the words became clearer
the language was undoubtedly english but its content was still maddeningly unintelligible
there is one combination of sounds that every human ear can detect instantly even in the noisiest environment
when it suddenly emerged from the jovian background it seemed to floyd that he could not possibly be awake but was trapped in some fantastic dream
his colleagues took a little longer to react then they stared at him with equal amazement and a slowly dawning suspicion
for the first recognizable words from europa were dr floyd dr floyd i hope you can hear me 11 ice and vacuum who is it whispered someone to a chorus of shushes
floyd raised his hands in a gesture of ignorance and he hoped innocence
know you are aboard leonov may not have much time aiming my suit antenna where i think the signal vanished for agonizing seconds then came back much clearer though not appreciably louder
relay this information to earth
tsien destroyed three hours ago
i m only survivor
using my suit radio no idea if it has enough range but it s the only chance
please listen carefully
there is life on europa
i repeat there is life on europa the signal faded again
a stunned silence followed that no one attempted to interrupt
while he was waiting floyd searched his memory furiously
he could riot recognize the voice it might have been that of any western educated chinese
probably it was someone he had met at a scientific conference but unless the speaker identified himself he would never know
soon after local midnight
we were pumping steadily and the tanks were almost half full
dr lee and i went out to check the pipe insulation
tsien stands stood about thirty metres from the edge of the grand canal
pipes go directly from it and down through the ice
very thin not safe to walk on
the warm upwelling again a long silence
floyd wondered if the speaker was moving and had been momentarily cut off by some obstruction
no problem five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship
like a christmas tree beautiful shining right through the ice
glorious colours
lee saw it first a huge dark mass rising up from the depths
at first we thought it was a school of fish too large for a single organism then it started to break through the ice
dr floyd i hope you can hear me
this is professor chang we met in 2 boston iau conference instantly incongruously floyd s thoughts were a billion kilometres away
he vaguely remembered that reception after the closing session of the international astronomical union congress the last one that the chinese had attended before the second cultural revolution
and now he recalled chang very distinctly a small humorous astronomer and exobiologist with a good fund of jokes
he wasn t joking now
like huge strands of wet seaweed crawling along the ground
lee ran back to the ship to get a camera i stayed to watch reporting over the radio
the thing moved so slowly i could easily outrun it
i was much more excited than alarmed
thought i knew what kind of creature it was i ve seen pictures of the kelp forests off california but i was quite wrong
i could tell it was in trouble
it couldn t possibly survive at a temperature a hundred and fifty below its normal environment
it was freezing solid as it moved forward bits were breaking off like glass but it was still advancing toward the ship a black tidal wave slowing down all the time
i was still so surprised that i couldn t think straight and i couldn t imagine what it was trying to do is there any way we can call him back floyd whispered urgently
no it s too late
europa will soon be behind jupiter
we ll have to wait until it comes out of eclipse climbing up the ship building a kind of ice tunnel as it advanced
perhaps this was insulating it from the cold the way termites protect themselves from the sunlight with their little corridors of mud
tons of ice on the ship
the radio antennas broke off first
then i could see the landing legs beginning to buckle all in slow motion like a dream
not until the ship started to topple did i realize what the thing was trying to do and then it was too late
we could have saved ourselves if we d only switched off those lights
perhaps it s a phototrope its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight that filters through the ice or it could have been attracted like a moth to a candle
our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that europa has ever known
then the ship crashed
i saw the hull split a cloud of snowflakes form as moisture condensed
all the lights went out except for one swinging back and forth on a cable a couple of metres above the ground
i don t know what happened immediately after that
the next thing i remember i was standing under the light beside the wreck of the ship with a fine powdering of fresh snow all around me
i could see my footsteps in it very clearly
i must have run there perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed
the plant i still thought of it as a plant was motionless
i wondered if it had been damaged by the impact large sections as thick as a man s arm had splintered off like broken twigs
then the main trunk started to move again
it pulled away from the hull and began to crawl toward me
that was when i knew for certain that the thing was light sensitive i was standing immediately under the thousand watt lamp which had stopped swinging now
imagine an oak tree better still a banyan with its multiple trunks and roots flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground
it got to within five metres of the light then started to spread out until it had made a perfect circle around me
presumably that was the limit of its tolerance the point at which photo attraction turned to repulsion
after that nothing happened for several minutes
i wondered if it was dead frozen solid at last
then i saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches
it was like watching a time lapse film of flowers opening
in fact i thought they were flowers each about as big as a man s head
delicate beautifully coloured membranes started to unfold
even then it occurred to me that no one no thing could ever have seen these colours before they had no existence until we brought our lights our fatal lights to this world
tendrils stamens waving feebly
i walked over to the living wall that surrounded me so that i could see exactly what was happening
neither then nor at any other time had i felt the slightest fear of the creature
i was certain that it was not malevolent if indeed it was conscious at all
there were scores of the big flowers in various stages of unfolding
now they reminded me of butterflies just emerging from the chrysalis wings crumpled still feeble i was getting closer and closer to the truth
but they were freezing dying as quickly as they formed
then one after another they dropped off from the parent buds
for a few moments they flopped around like fish stranded on dry land at last i realized exactly what they were
those membranes weren t petals they were fins or their equivalent
this was the free swimming larval stage of the creature
probably it spends much of its life rooted on the seabed then sends these mobile offspring in search of new territory
just like the corals of earth s oceans
i knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures
the beautiful colours were fading now to a drab brown
some of the petal fins had snapped off becoming brittle shards as they froze
but it was still moving feebly and as i approached it tried to avoid me
i wondered how it sensed my presence
then i noticed that the stamens as i d called them all carried bright blue dots at their tips
they looked like tiny star sapphires or the blue eyes along the mantle of a scallop aware of light but unable to form true images
as i watched the vivid blue faded the sapphires became dull ordinary stones
dr floyd or anyone else who is listening i haven t much more time jupiter will soon block my signal
but i ve almost finished
i knew then what i had to do
the cable to that thousand watt lamp was hanging almost to the ground
i gave it a few tugs and the light went out in a shower of sparks
i wondered if it was too late
for a few minutes nothing happened
so i walked over to the wall of tangled branches around me and kicked it
slowly the creature started to unweave itself and to retreat back to the canal
there was plenty of light i could see everything perfectly
ganymede and callisto were in the sky jupiter was a huge thin crescent and there was a big auroral display on the nightside at the jovian end of the io flux tube
there was no need to use my helmet light
i followed the creature all the way back to the water encouraging it with more kicks when it slowed down feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the time beneath my boots as it neared the canal it seemed to gain strength and energy as if it knew that it was approaching its natural home
i wondered if it would survive to bud again
it disappeared through the surface leaving a few last dead larvae on the alien land
the exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab of protective ice sealed it from the vacuum above
then i walked back to the ship to see if there was anything to salvage i don t want to talk about that
i ve only two requests to make doctor
when the taxonomists classify this creature i hope they ll name it after me
and when the next ship comes home ask them to take our bones back to china
jupiter will be cutting us off in a few minutes
i wish i knew whether anyone was receiving me
anyway i ll repeat this message when we re in line of sight again if my suit s life support system lasts that long
this is professor chang on europa reporting the destruction of spaceship tsien
we landed beside the grand canal and set up our pumps at the edge of the ice
the signal faded abruptly came back for a moment then disappeared completely be1ow the noise level
although leonov listened again on the same frequency there was no further message from professor chang
iii discovery 12 downhill run the ship was gaining speed at last on the downhill run toward jupiter
it had long since passed the gravitational no man s land where the four tiny outer moons sinope pasiphae ananke and carme wobbled along their retrograde and wildly eccentric orbits
undoubtedly captured asteroids and completely irregular in shape the largest was only thirty kilometres across
jagged splintered rocks of no interest to anyone except planetary geologists their allegiance wavered continually between the sun and jupiter
one day the sun would recapture them completely
but jupiter might retain the second group of four at half the distance of the others
elara lysithea himalia and leda were fairly close together and lying in almost the same plane
there was speculation that they had once been part of a single body if so the parent would have been barely a hundred kilometres across
though only carme and leda came close enough to show disks visible to the naked eye they were greeted like old friends
here was the first landfall after the longest ocean voyage the offshore islands of jupiter
the last hours were ticking away the most critical phase of the entire mission was approaching the entry into the jovian atmosphere
jupiter was already larger than the moon in the skies of earth and the giant inner satellites could be clearly seen moving around it
they all showed noticeable disks and distinctive colouring though they were still too far away for any markings to be visible
the eternal ballet they performed disappearing behind jupiter reappearing to transit the daylight face with their accompanying shadows was an endlessly engaging spectacle
it was one that astronomers had watched ever since galileo had first glimpsed it almost exactly four centuries ago but the crew of leonov were the only living men and women to have seen it with unaided eyes
the interminable chess games had ceased off duty hours were spent at the telescopes or in earnest conversation or listening to music usually while gazing at the view outside
and at least one shipboard romance had reached a culmination the frequent disappearances of max brailovsky and zenia marchenko were the subject of much good natured banter
they were thought floyd an oddly matched pair
max was a big handsome blond who had been a champion gymnast reaching the finals of the 2 olympics
though he was in his early thirties he had an open faced almost boyish expression
this was not altogether misleading despite his brilliant engineering record he often struck floyd as naive and unsophisticated one of those people who are pleasant to talk to but not for too long
outside his own field of undoubted expertise he was engaging but rather shallow
zenia at twenty nine the youngest on board was still something of a mystery
since no one wished to talk about it floyd had never raised the subject of her injuries and his washington sources could provide no information
obviously she had been involved in some serious accident but it might have been nothing more unusual than a car crash
the theory that she had been on a secret space mission still part of popular mythology outside the ussr could be ruled out
thanks to the global tracking networks no such thing had been possible for fifty years
in addition to her physical and doubtless psychological scars zenia laboured under yet another handicap
she was a last minute replacement and everyone knew it
irma yakunina was to have been dietician and medical assistant aboard leonov before that unfortunate argument with a hang glider broke too many bones
every day at 18 gmt the crew of seven plus one passenger gathered in the tiny common room that separated the flight deck from the galley and sleeping quarters
the circular table at its centre was just big enough for eight people to squeeze around when chandra and curnow were revived it would be unable to accommodate everyone and two extra seats would have to be fitted in somewhere else
though the six o clock soviet as the daily round table conference was called seldom lasted more than ten minutes it played a vital role in maintaining morale
complaints suggestions criticisms progress reports anything could be raised subject only to the captain s overriding veto which was very seldom exercised
typical items on the non existent agenda were requests for changes in the menu appeals for more private communication time with earth suggested movie programmes exchange of news and gossip and good natured needling of the heavily outnumbered american contingent
things would change floyd warned them when his colleagues came out of hibernation and the odds improved from 1 in 7 to 3 in 9
he did not mention his private belief that curnow could outtalk or outshout any three other people aboard
when he was not sleeping much of floyd s own time was spent in the common room partly because despite its smallness it was much less claustrophobic than his own tiny cubicle
it was also cheerfully decorated all available flat surfaces being covered with photos of beautiful land and seascapes sporting events portraits of popular videostars and other reminders of earth
pride of place however was given to an original leonov painting his 1965 study beyond the moon made in the same year when as a young lieutenant colonel he left voskhod ii and became the first man in history to perform an extravehicular excursions clearly the work of a talented amateur rather than a professional it showed the cratered edge of the moon with the beautiful sinus lridum bay of rainbows in the foreground
looming monstrously above the lunar horizon was the thin crescent of earth embracing the darkened nightside of the planet
beyond that blazed the sun the streamers of the corona reaching out into space for millions of kilometres around it
it was a striking composition and a glimpse of the future that even then lay only three years ahead
on the flight of apollo 8 anders borman and lovell were to see this splendid sight with their unaided eyes as they watched earth rise above the farside on christmas day 1968
heywood floyd admired the painting but he also regarded it with mixed feelings
he could not forget that it was older than everybody else on the ship with one exception
he was already nine years old when alexei leonov had painted it
13 the worlds of galileo even now more than three decades after the revelations of the first voyager flybys no one really understood why the four giant satellites differed so wildly from one another
they were all about the same size and in the same part of the solar system yet they were totally dissimilar as if children of a different birth
only callisto the outermost had turned out to be much as expected
when leonov raced past at a distance of just over 1 kilometres the larger of its countless craters were clearly visible to the naked eye
through the telescope the satellite looked like a glass ball that had been used as a target by high powered rifles it was completely covered with craters of every size right down to the lower limit of visibility
callisto someone had once remarked looked more like earth s moon than did the moon itself
nor was this particularly surprising
one would have expected a world out here at the edge of the asteroid belt to have been bombarded with the debris left over from the creation of the solar system
yet ganymede the satellite next door had a totally different appearance
though it had been well peppered with impact craters in the remote past most of them had been ploughed over a phrase that seemed peculiarly appropriate
huge areas of ganymede were covered with ridges and furrows as if some cosmic gardener had dragged a giant rake across them
and there were light coloured streaks like trails that might have been made by slugs fifty kilometres across
most mysterious of all were long meandering bands containing dozens of parallel lines
it was nikolai ternovsky who decided what they must be multilane superhighways laid out by drunken surveyors
he even claimed to have detected over passes and cloverleaf intersections
leonov had added some trillions of bits of information about ganymede to the store of human knowledge before it crossed the orbit of europa
that icebound world with its derelict and its dead was on the other side of jupiter but it was never far from anyone s thoughts
back on earth dr chang was already a hero and his countrymen had with obvious embarrassment acknowledged countless messages of sympathy
one had been sent in the name of leonov s crew after floyd gathered considerable redrafting in moscow
the feeling on board the ship was ambiguous a mixture of admiration regret and relief
all astronauts irrespective of their national origins regarded themselves as citizens of space and felt a common bond sharing each other s triumphs and tragedies
no one on leonov was happy because the chinese expedition had met with disaster yet at the same time there was a muted sense of relief that the race had not gone to the swiftest
the unexpected discovery of life on europa had added a new element to the situation one that was now being argued at great length both on earth and aboard leonov
some exobiologists cried i told you so pointing out that it should not have been such a surprise after all
as far back as the 197 s research submarines had found teeming colonies of strange marine creatures thriving precariously in an environment thought to be equally hostile to life the trenches on the bed of the pacific
volcanic springs fertilizing and warming the abyss had created oases of life in the deserts of the deep
anything that had happened once on earth should be expected millions of times elsewhere in the universe that was almost an article of faith among scientists
water or at least ice occurred on all the moons of jupiter
and there were continuously erupting volcanoes on io so it was reasonable to expect weaker activity on the world next door
putting these two facts together made europan life seem not only possible but inevitable as most of nature s surprises are when viewed with 2 2 hindsight
yet that conclusion raised another question and one vital to leonov s mission
now that life had been discovered on the moons of jupiter did it have any connection with the tycho monolith and the still more mysterious artifact in orbit near io
that was a favourite subject to debate in the six o clock soviets
it was generally agreed that the creature encountered by dr chang did not represent a high form of intelligence at least if his interpretation of its behaviour was correct
no animal with even elementary powers of reasoning would have allowed itself to become a victim of its instincts attracted like a moth to the candle until it risked destruction
vasili orlov was quick to give a counter example that weakened if it did not refute that argument
look at whales and dolphins he said
we call them intelligent but how often they kill themselves in mass strandings
that looks like a case where instinct overpowers reason no need to go to the dolphins interjected max brailovsky
one of the brightest engineers in my class was fatally attracted to a blonde in kiev
when i heard of him last he was working in a garage
and he d won a gold medal for designing spacestations
what a waste even if dr chang s europan was intelligent that of course did not rule out higher forms elsewhere
the biology of a whole world could not be judged from a single specimen
but it had been widely argued that advanced intelligence could never arise in the sea there were not enough challenges in so benign and unvarying an environment
above all how could marine creatures ever develop a technology without the aid of fire
yet perhaps even that was possible the route that humanity had taken was not the only one
there might be whole civilizations in the seas of other worlds
still it seemed unlikely that a space faring culture could have arisen on europa without leaving unmistakable signs of its existence in the form of buildings scientific installations launching sites or other artifacts
but from pole to pole nothing could be seen but level ice and a few outcroppings of bare rock
no time remained for speculations and discussions when leonov hurtled past the orbits of io and tiny mimas
the crew was busy almost non stop preparing for the encounter and the brief onset of weight after months in free fall
all loose objects had to be secured before the ship entered jupiter s atmosphere and the drag of deceleration produced momentary peaks that might be as high as two gravities
floyd was lucky he alone had time to admire the superb spectacle of the approaching planet now filling almost half the sky
because there was nothing to give it scale there was no way that the mind could grasp its real size
he had to keep telling himself that fifty earths would not cover the hemisphere now turned toward him
the clouds colourful as the most garish sunset on earth raced so swiftly that he could see appreciable movement in as little as ten minutes
great eddies were continually forming along the dozen or so bands that girdled the planet then rippling away like swirls of smoke
plumes of white gas occasionally geysered up from the depths to be swept away by the gales caused by the planet s tremendous spin
and perhaps strangest of all were the white spots sometimes spaced as regularly as pearls on a necklace which lay along the tradewinds of the middle jovian latitudes
in the hours immediately before encounter floyd saw little of captain or navigator
the orlovs scarcely left the bridge as they continually checked the approach orbit and made minute refinements to leonov s course
the ship was now on the critical path that would just graze the outer atmosphere if it went too high frictional braking would not be sufficient to slow it down and it would go racing out of the solar system beyond all possibility of rescue
if it went too low it would burn up like a meteor
between the two extremes lay little margin for error
the chinese had proved that aerobraking could be done but there was always the chance that something would go wrong so floyd was not at all surprised when surgeon commander rudenko admitted just an hour before contact i m beginning to wish woody that i had brought along that icon after all 14 double encounter papers for the mortgage on the nantucket house should be in the file marked m in the library
well that s all the business i can think of
for the last couple of hours i ve been recalling a picture i saw as a boy in a tattered volume of victorian art it must have been almost one hundred and fifty years old
i can t remember whether it was black and white or colour
but i ll never forget the title don t laugh it was called the last message home
our great great grandfathers loved that kind of sentimental melodrama
it shows the deck of a windjammer in a hurricane the sails have been ripped away and the deck s awash
in the background the crew is struggling to save the ship
and in the foreground a young sailor boy s writing a note while beside him is the bottle he hopes will carry it to land
even though i was a kid at the time i felt he should have been giving his shipmates a hand not writing letters
all the same it moved me i never thought that one day i d be like that young sailor
of course i m sure you ll get this message and there s nothing i can do to help aboard leonov
in fact i ve been politely requested to keep out of the way so my conscience is quite clear as i dictate this
i ll send it up to the bridge now because in fifteen minutes we ll break transmission as we pull in the big dish and batten down the hatches there s another nice maritime analogy for you
jupiter s filling the sky now i won t attempt to describe it and won t even see it much longer because the shutters will go up in a few minutes
anyway the cameras can do far better than i could
goodbye my dearest and my love to you all especially chris
by the time you get this it will be over one way or the other
remember i tried to do my best for all our sakes goodbye when he had removed the audio chip floyd drifted up to the communications centre and handed it over to sasha kovalev
please make sure it gets off before we close down he said earnestly
don t worry promised sasha
i m still working on all channels and we have a good ten minutes left he held out his hand
if we do meet again why we shall smile
if not why then this parting was well made floyd blinked
shakespeare i suppose of course brutus and cassius before battle
see you later tanya and vasili were too intent upon their situation displays to do more than wave to floyd and he retreated to his cabin
he had already said farewell to the rest of the crew there was nothing to do but wait
his sleeping bag was slung in preparation for the return of gravity when deceleration commenced and he had only to climb into it antennas retracted all protective shields up said the intercom speaker
we should feel first braking in five minutes
everything normal that s hardly the word i d use floyd muttered to himself
i think you mean nominal he had barely concluded the thought when there was a diffident knock on the door
kto tam to his astonishment it was zenia
do you mind if i come in she asked awkwardly in a small girl voice which floyd could scarcely recognize
of course not
but why aren t you in your own cubicle
it s only five minutes to re entry even as he asked the question he was aware of its foolishness
the answer was so perfectly obvious that zenia did not deign to reply
but zenia was the very last person he would have expected her attitude toward him had invariably been polite but distant
indeed she was the only member of the crew who preferred to call him dr floyd
yet there she was clearly seeking comfort and companionship at the moment of peril
zenia my dear he said wryly
you re welcome
but my accommodation is somewhat limited
one might even call it spartan she managed a faint smile but said nothing as she floated into the room
for the first time floyd realized that she was not merely nervous she was terrified
then he understood why she had come to him
she was ashamed to face her countrymen and was looking for support elsewhere
with this realization his pleasure at the unexpected encounter abated somewhat
that did not lessen his responsibility to another lonely human being a long way from home
the fact that she was an attractive though certainly not beautiful woman of barely half his own age should not have affected the issue
but it did he was beginning to rise to the occasion
she must have noticed but did nothing to encourage or discourage him as they lay down side by side in the sleeping cocoon
there was just enough room for them both and floyd began to do some anxious calculations
suppose maximum gee was higher than predicted and the suspension gave way
they could easily be killed
there was an ample safety margin no need to worry about such an ignominious end
humour was the enemy of desire their embrace was now completely chaste
he was not sure whether to be glad or sorry
and it was too late for second thoughts
from far far away came the first faint whisper of sound like the wailing of some lost soul
at the same moment the ship gave a barely perceptible jerk the cocoon began to swing around and its suspension tightened
after weeks of weightlessness gravity was returning
within seconds the faint wail had risen to a steady roar and the cocoon had become an overloaded hammock
this is not such a good idea floyd thought to himself already it was difficult to breathe
the deceleration was only a part of the problem zenia was clutching him as a drowning person is supposed to clutch the proverbial straw
he detached her as gently as he could
it s all right zenia
if tsien did it so can we
relax don t worry it was difficult to shout tenderly and he was not even sure if zenia heard him above the roar of incandescent hydrogen
but she was no longer clutching him quite so desperately and he seized the opportunity of taking a few deep breaths
what would caroline think if she could see him now
would he tell her if he ever had the chance
he was not sure she would understand
at a moment like that all links with earth seemed very tenuous indeed
it was impossible to move or to speak but now that he had grown accustomed to the strange sense of weight he was no longer uncomfortable except for the increasing numbness in his right arm
with some difficulty he managed to extricate it from beneath zenia the familiar act brought a fleeting sense of guilt
as he felt his circulation returning floyd remembered a famous remark attributed to at least a dozen astronauts and cosmonauts both the pleasures and problems of zero gravity sex have been greatly exaggerated he wondered how the rest of the crew was faring and he gave a momentary thought to chandra and curnow sleeping peacefully through it all
they would never know if leonov became a meteor shower in the jovian sky
he did not envy them they had missed the experience of a lifetime
tanya was speaking over the intercom her words were lost in the roar but her voice sounded calm and perfectly normal just as if she was making a routine announcement
floyd managed to glance at his watch and was astonished to see that they were already at the midpoint of the braking manoeuvre
at that very moment leonov was at its closest approach to jupiter only expendable automatic probes had gone deeper into the jovian atmosphere
halfway through zenia he shouted
on the way out again he could not tell if she understood
her eyes were tightly closed but she smiled slightly
the ship was now rocking noticeably like a small boat in a choppy sea
was that normal
wondered floyd
he was glad that he had zenia to worry about it took his mind away from his own fears
just for a moment before he managed to expel the thought he had a vision of the walls suddenly glowing cherry red and caving in upon him
like the nightmare fantasy of edgar allan poe s the pit and the pendulum which he d forgotten for thirty years
but that would never happen
if the heat shield failed the ship would crumble instantly hammered flat by a solid wall of gas
there would be no pain his nervous system would not have time to react before it ceased to exist
he had experienced more consoling thoughts but this one was not to be despised
the buffeting slowly weakened
there was another inaudible announcement from tanya he would pull her leg about that when it was all over
now time seemed to be going much more slowly after a while he stopped looking at his watch because he could not believe it
the digits changed so slowly that he could almost imagine himself in some einsteinian time dilation
and then something even more unbelievable happened
first he was amused then slightly indignant
zenia had fallen asleep if not exactly in his arms then at least beside them
it was a natural reaction the strain must have exhausted her and the wisdom of the body had come to her rescue
and suddenly floyd himself became aware of an almost post orgasmic drowsiness as if he too had been emotionally drained by the encounter
he had to fight to remain awake
and then he was falling falling falling it was all over
the ship was back in space where it belonged
and he and zenia were floating apart
they would never again be so close together but they would always know a special tenderness toward each other which no one else could ever share
15 escape from the giant when floyd reached the observation deck a discreet few minutes after zenia jupiter already seemed farther away
but that must be an illusion based on his knowledge not the evidence of his eyes
they had barely emerged from the jovian atmosphere and the planet still filled half the sky
and now they were as intended its prisoners
during the last incandescent hour they had deliberately jettisoned the excess speed that could have carried them right out of the solar system and on to the stars
now they were travelling in an ellipse a classical hohmann orbit which would shuttle them back between jupiter and the orbit of io 35 kilometres higher
if they did not or could not fire their motors again leonov would swing back and forth between these limits completing one revolution every nineteen hours
it would become the closest of jupiter s moons though not for long
each time it grazed the atmosphere it would lose altitude until it spiralled into destruction
floyd had never really enjoyed vodka but he joined the others without any reservations in drinking a triumphant toast to the ship s designers coupled with a vote of thanks to sir isaac newton
then tanya put the bottle firmly back in its cupboard there was still much to be done
though they were all expecting it everyone jumped at the sudden muffled thud of explosive charges and the jolt of separation
a few seconds later a large still glowing disk floated into view slowly turning end over end as it drifted away from the ship
look cried max
a flying saucer
who s got a camera there was a distinct note of hysterical relief in the laughter that followed
it was interrupted by the captain in a more serious vein
goodbye faithful heat shield
you did a wonderful job but what a waste said sasha
there s at least a couple of tons left think of all the extra payload we could have carried if that s good conservative russian engineering retorted floyd then i m all for it
far better a few tons too much than one milligram too little everyone applauded those noble sentiments as the jetti soned shield cooled to yellow then red and finally became as black as the space around it
it vanished from sight while only a few kilometres away though occasionally the sudden reappearance of an eclipsed star would betray its presence
preliminary orbit check completed said vasili
we re within ten metres a second of our right vector
not bad for a first try there was a subdued sigh of relief at the news and a few minutes later vasili made another announcement
changing attitude for course correction delta vee six metres a second
twenty second burn coming up in one minute they were still so close to jupiter it was impossible to believe that the ship was orbiting the planet they might have been in a high flying aircraft that had just emerged from a sea of clouds
there was no sense of scale it was easy to imagine that they were speeding away from some terrestrial sunset the reds and pinks and crimsons sliding below were so familiar
and that was an illusion nothing here had any parallels with earth
those colours were intrinsic not borrowed from the setting sun
the very gases were utterly alien methane and ammonia and a witch s brew of hydrocarbons stirred in a hydrogen helium cauldron
not one trace of free oxygen the breath of human life
the clouds marched from horizon to horizon in parallel rows distorted by occasional swirls and eddies
here and there upwellings of brighter gas broke the pattern and floyd could also see the dark rim of a great whirlpool a maelstrom of gas leading down into unfathomable jovian depths
he began to look for the great red spot then quickly checked himself at such a foolish thought
all the enormous cloudscape he could see below would be only a few per cent of the red spot s immensity one might as well expect to recognize the shape of the united states from a small aeroplane flying low above kansas
correction completed
we re now on interception orbit with io
arrival time eight hours fifty five minutes less than nine hours to climb up from jupiter and meet whatever is waiting for us thought floyd
we ve escaped from the giant but he represents a danger we understood and could prepare for
what lies ahead now is utter mystery
and when we have survived that challenge we must return to jupiter once again
we shall need his strength to send us safely home
16 private line hello dimitri
this is woody switching to key two in fifteen seconds hello dimitri multiply keys three and four take cube root add pi squared and use nearest integer as key five
unless your computers are a million times faster than ours and i m damn sure they re not no one can decrypt this on your side or mine
but you may have some explaining to do anyway you re good at that
by the way my usual excellent sources told me about the failure of the latest attempt to persuade old andrei to resign i gather that your delegation had no more luck than the others and you re still saddled with him as president
i m laughing my head off it serves the academy right
i know he s over ninety and growing a bit well stubborn
but you won t get any help from me even though i m the world s sorry solar system s leading expert on the painless removal of elderly scientists
would you believe that i m still slightly drunk
we felt we deserved a little party once we d successfully rendez rendezvous damn rendezvoused with discovery
besides we had two new crew members to welcome aboard
chandra doesn t believe in alcohol it makes you too human but walter curnow more than made up for him only tanya remained stone cold sober just as you d expect
my fellow americans i sound like a politician god help me came out of hibernation without any problems and are both looking forward to starting work
we ll all have to move quickly not only is time running out but discovery seems to be in very bad shape
we could hardly believe our eyes when we saw how its spotless white hull had turned a sickly yellow
io s to blame of course
the ship s spiralled down to within three thousand kilometres and every few days one of the volcanoes blasts a few megatons of sulphur up into the sky
even though you ve seen the movies you can t really imagine what it s like to hang above that inferno i ll be glad when we can get away even though we ll be heading for something much more mysterious and perhaps far more dangerous
i flew over kilauea during the 6 eruption that was mighty scary but it was nothing nothing compared to this
at the moment we re over the nightside and that makes it worse
you can see just enough to imagine a lot more
it s as close to hell as i ever want to get
some of the sulphur lakes are hot enough to glow but most of the light comes from electrical discharges
every few minutes the whole landscape seems to explode as if a giant photoflash has gone off above it
and that s probably not a bad analogy there are millions of amps flowing in the flux tube linking io and jupiter and every so often there s a breakdown
then you get the biggest lightning flash in the solar system and half our circuit breakers jump out in sympathy
there s just been an eruption right on the terminator and i can see a huge cloud expanding up toward us climbing into the sunlight
i doubt if it will reach our altitude and even if it does it will be harmless by the time it gets here
but it looks ominous a space monster trying to devour us
soon after we got here i realized that io reminded me of something it took me a couple of days to work it out and then i had to check with mission archives because the ship s library couldn t help shame on it
do you remember how i introduced you to the lord of the rings when we were kids back at that oxford conference
well io is mordor look up part three
there s a passage about rivers of molten rock that wound their way until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon shapes vomited from the tormented earth that s a perfect description how did tolkien know a quarter century before anyone ever saw a picture of io
talk about nature imitating art
at least we won t have to land there i don t think that even our late chinese colleagues would have attempted that
but perhaps one day it may be possible there are areas that seem fairly stable and not continually inundated by sulphur floods
who would have believed that we d come all the way to jupiter greatest of planets and then ignore it
yet that s what we re doing most of the time and when we re not looking at io or discovery we re thinking about the artifact
it s still ten thousand kilometres away up there at the libration point but when i look at it through the main telescope it seems close enough to touch
because it s so completely featureless there s no indication of size no way the eye can judge it s really a couple of kilometres long
if it s solid it must weigh billions of tons
but is it solid
it gives almost no radar echo even when it s square on to us
we can see it only as a black silhouette against the clouds of jupiter three hundred thousand kilometres below
apart from its size it looks exactly like the monolith we dug up on the moon
well tomorrow we ll go aboard discovery and i don t know when i ll have time or opportunity to speak to you again
but there s one more thing old friend before i sign off
it s caroline
she s never really understood why i had to leave earth and in a way i don t think she ll ever quite forgive me
some women believe that love isn t the only thing but everything
perhaps they re right anyway it s certainly too late to argue now
try and cheer her up when you have a chance
she talks about going back to the mainland
i m afraid that if she does if you can t get through to her try to cheer up chris
i miss him more than i care to say
he ll believe uncle dimitri if you say that his father still loves him and will be coming home just as quickly as he can 17 boarding party even in the best of circumstances it is not easy to board a derelict and uncooperative spaceship
indeed it can be positively dangerous
walter curnow knew that as an abstract principle but he did not really feel it in his bones until he saw the entire hundred metre length of discovery turning end over end while leonov kept at a safe distance
years ago friction had braked the spin of discovery s carousel thus transferring its angular momentum to the rest of the structure
now like a drum majorette s baton at the height of its trajectory the abandoned ship was slowly tumbling along its orbit
the first problem was to stop that spin which made discovery not only uncontrollable but almost unapproachable
as he suited up in the airlock with max brailovsky curnow had a very rare sensation of incompetence even inferiority it was not his line of business
he had already explained gloomily i m a space engineer not a space monkey but the job had to be done
he alone possessed the skills that could save discovery from io s grasp
max and his colleagues working with unfamiliar circuit diagrams and equipment would take far too long
by the time they had restored power to the ship and mastered its controls it would have plunged into the sulphurous firepits below
you re not scared are you asked max when they were about to put on their helmets
not enough to make a mess in my suit
otherwise yes max chuckled
i d say that s about right for this job
but don t worry i ll get you there in one piece with my what do you call it broomstick
because witches are supposed to ride them oh yes
have you ever used one i tried once but mine got away from me
everyone else thought it was very funny there are some professions which have evolved unique and characteristic tools the longshoreman s hook the potter s wheel the bricklayer s trowel the geologist s hammer
the men who had to spend much of their time on zero gravity construction projects had developed the broomstick
it was very simple a hollow tube just a metre long with a footpad at one end and a retaining loop at the other
at the touch of a button it could telescope out to five or six times its normal length and the internal shock absorbing system allowed a skilled operator to perform the most amazing manoeuvres
the footpad could also become a claw or hook if necessary there were many other refinements but that was the basic design
it looked deceptively easy to use it wasn t
the airlock pumps finished recycling the exit sign came on the outer doors opened and they drifted slowly into the void
discovery was windmilling about two hundred metres away following them in orbit around io which filled half the sky
jupiter was invisible on the other side of the satellite
this was a matter of deliberate choice they were using io as a shield to protect them from the energies raging back and forth in the flux tube that linked the two worlds
even so the radiation level was dangerously high they had less than fifteen minutes before they must get back to shelter
almost immediately curnow had a problem with his suit
it fitted me when i left earth he complained
but now i m rattling around inside like a pea in a pod that s perfectly normal walter said surgeon commander rudenko breaking into the radio circuit
you lost ten kilos in hibernation which you could very well afford to miss
and you ve already put three of them back before curnow had time to think of a suitable retort he found himself gently but firmly jerked away from leonov
just relax walter said brailovsky
don t use your thrusters even if you start tumbling
let me do all the work curnow could see the faint puffs from the younger man s backpack as its tiny jets drove them toward discovery
with each little cloud of vapour there came a gentle tug on the towline and he would start moving toward brailovsky but he never caught up with him before the next puff came
he felt rather like a yo yo now making one of its periodic comebacks on earth bouncing up and down on its string
there was only one safe way to approach the derelict and that was along the axis around which it was slowly revolving
discovery s centre of rotation was approximately amidships near the main antenna complex and brailovsky was heading directly toward this area with his anxious partner in tow
how will he stop both of us in time
curnow asked himself
discovery was now a huge slender dumbbell slowly flailing the entire sky ahead of them
though it took several minutes to complete one revolution the far ends were moving at an impressive speed
curnow tried to ignore them and concentrated on the approaching and immobile centre
i m aiming for that said brailovsky
don t try to help and don t be surprised at anything that happens now what does he mean by that
curnow asked himself while preparing to be as unsurprised as possible
everything happened in about five seconds
brailovsky triggered his broomstick so that it telescoped out to its full length of four metres and made contact with the approaching ship
the broomstick started to collapse its internal spring absorbing brailovsky s considerable momentum but it did not as curnow had fully expected bring him to rest beside the antenna mount
it immediately expanded again reversing the russian s velocity so that he was in effect reflected away from discovery just as rapidly as he had approached
he flashed past curnow heading out into space again only a few centimetres away
the startled american just had time to glimpse a large grin before brailovsky shot past him
a second later there was a jerk on the line connecting them and a quick surge of deceleration as they shared momentum
their opposing velocities had been neatly cancelled they were virtually at rest with respect to discovery
curnow had merely to reach out to the nearest handhold and drag them both in
have you ever tried russian roulette he asked when he had got his breath back
no what is it i must teach you sometime
it s almost as good as this for curing boredom i hope you re not suggesting walter that max would do anything dangerous dr rudenko sounded as if she was genuinely shocked and curnow decided it was best not to answer sometimes the russians did not understand his peculiar sense of humour
you could have fooled me he muttered under his breath not loud enough for her to hear
now that they were firmly attached to the hub of the windmilling ship he was no longer conscious of its rotation especially when he fixed his gaze upon the metal plates immediately before his eyes
the ladder stretching away into the distance running along the slender cylinder that was discovery s main structure was his next objective
the spherical command module at its far end seemed several light years away though he knew perfectly well that the distance was only fifty metres
i ll go first said brailovsky reeling in the slack on the line linking them together
remember it s downhill all the way from here
but that s no problem you can hold on with one hand
even at the bottom gravity s only about a tenth gee
and that s what do you say
chickenshit i think you mean chickenfeed
and if it s all the same to you i m going feet first
i never liked crawling down ladders the wrong way up even in fractional gravity it was essential curnow was very well aware to keep up this gently bantering tone otherwise he would be simply overwhelmed by the mystery and danger of the situation
there he was almost a billion kilometres from home about to enter the most famous derelict in the entire history of space exploration a media reporter had once called discovery the marie celeste of space and that was not a bad analogy
but there was also much that made his situation unique even if he tried to ignore the nightmare moonscape filling half the sky there was a constant reminder of its presence at hand
every time he touched the rungs of the ladder his glove dislodged a thin mist of sulphur dust
brailovsky of course was quite correct the rotational gravity caused by the ship s end over end tumbling was easily countered
as he grew used to it curnow even welcomed the sense of direction it gave him
and then quite suddenly they had reached the big discoloured sphere of discovery s control and life support module
only a few metres away was an emergency hatch the very one curnow realized that bowman had entered for his final confrontation with hal
hope we can get in muttered brailovsky
pity to come all this way and find the door locked he scraped away the sulphur obscuring the airlock status display panel
dead of course
shall i try the controls won t do any harm but nothing will happen you re right
well here goes with manual
it was fascinating to watch the narrow hairline open in the curved wall and to note the little puff of vapour dispersing into space carrying with it a scrap of paper
was that some vital message
they would never know it spun away tumbling end over end without losing any of its initial spin as it disappeared against the stars
brailovsky kept turning the manual control for what seemed a very long time before the dark uninviting cave of the airlock was completely open
curnow had hoped that the emergency lights at least might still be operating
no such luck
you re boss now walter
welcome to us territory it certainly did not look very welcoming as he clambered inside flashing the beam of his helmet light around the interior
as far as curnow could tell everything was in good order
what else had he expected
he asked himself half angrily
closing the door manually took even longer than opening it but there was no alternative until the ship was powered up again
just before the hatch was sealed curnow risked a glance at the insane panorama outside
a flickering blue lake had opened up near the equator he was sure it had not been there a few hours earlier
brilliant yellow flares the characteristic colour of glowing sodium were dancing along its edges and the whole of the nightland was veiled in the ghostly plasma discharge of one of io s almost continuous auroras
it was the stuff of future nightmares and as if that was not sufficient there was one further touch worthy of a mad surrealist artist
stabbing up into the black sky apparently emerging directly from the firepits of the burning moon was an immense curving horn such as a doomed bullfighter might have glimpsed in the final moment of truth
the crescent of jupiter was rising to greet discovery and leonov as they swept toward it along their common orbit
18 salvage the moment that the outer hatch had closed behind them there had been a subtle reversal of roles
curnow was at home now while brailovsky was out of his element feeling ill at ease in the labyrinth of pitch black corridors and tunnels that was discovery s interior
in theory max knew his way round the ship but that knowledge was based only on a study of its design drawings
curnow on the other hand had spent months working in discovery s still uncompleted identical twin he could quite literally find his way around blindfolded
progress was made difficult because that part of the ship was designed for zero gee now the uncontrolled spin provided an artificial gravity which slight though it was always seemed to be in the most inconvenient direction
first thing we ve got to do muttered curnow after sliding several metres down a corridor before he could grab a handhold is to stop this damned spin
and we can t do that until we have power
i only hope that dave bowman safeguarded all systems before he abandoned ship are you sure he did abandon the ship
he may have intended to come back you may be right i don t suppose we ll ever know
if he even knew himself they had now entered the pod bay discovery s space garage which normally contained three of the spherical one man modules used for activities outside the ship
only pod number 3 remained number 1 had been lost in the mysterious accident that had killed frank poole and number 2 was with dave bowman wherever he might be
the pod bay also contained two spacesuits looking uncomfortably like decapitated corpses as they hung helmet less in their racks
it needed very little effort of the imagination and brailovsky s was now working overtime to fill them with a whole menagerie of sinister occupants
it was unfortunate but not altogether surprising that curnow s sometimes irresponsible sense of humour got the better of him at this very moment
max he said in a tone of deadly seriousness whatever happens please don t go chasing off after the ship s cat for a few milliseconds brailovsky was thrown off guard he almost answered i do wish you hadn t said that walter but checked himself in time
that would have been too damning an admission of weakness instead he replied i d like to meet the idiot who put that movie in our library katerina probably did it to test everyone s psychological balance
anyway you laughed your head off when we screened it last week brailovsky was silent curnow s remark was perfectly true
but that had been back in the familiar warmth and light of leonov among his friends not in a pitch black freezing derelict haunted by ghosts
no matter how rational one was it was all too easy to imagine some implacable alien beast prowling these corridors seeking whom it might devour
it s all your fault grandma may the siberian tundra lie lightly on your beloved bones i wish you hadn t filled my mind with so many of those gruesome legends
if i close my eyes i can still see the hut of the baba yaga standing in that forest clearing on its scrawny chicken legs
enough of this nonsense
i m a brilliant young engineer faced with the biggest technical challenge of his life and i mustn t let my american friend know that i m sometimes a frightened little boy
the noises did not help
there were too many of them though they were so faint that only an experienced astronaut would have detected them against the sounds of his own suit
but to max brailovsky accustomed to working in an environment of utter silence they were distinctly unnerving even though he knew that the occasional cracklings and creakings were almost certainly caused by thermal expansion as the ship turned like a roast on a spit
feeble though the sun was out here there was still an appreciable temperature change between light and shade
even his familiar spacesuit felt wrong now that there was pressure outside as well as in
all the forces acting on its joints were subtly altered and he could no longer judge his movements accurately
i m a beginner starting my training all over again he told himself angrily
time to break the mood by some decisive action
walter i d like to test the atmosphere pressure s okay temperature phew it s one hundred five below zero a nice bracing russian winter
anyway the air in my suit will keep out the worst of the cold well go ahead
but let me shine my light on your face so i can see if you start to turn blue
and keep talking brailovsky unsealed his visor and swung the faceplate upward
he flinched momentarily as icy fingers seemed to caress his cheeks then took a cautious sniff followed by a deeper breath
chilly but my lungs aren t freezing
there s a funny smell though
stale rotten as if something s oh no looking suddenly pale brailovsky quickly snapped the faceplate shut
what s the trouble max curnow asked with sudden and now perfectly genuine anxiety
brailovsky did not reply he looked as if he was still trying to regain control of himself
indeed he seemed in real danger of that always horrible and sometimes fatal disaster vomiting in a spacesuit
there was a long silence then curnow said reassuringly i get it
but i m sure you re wrong
we know that poole was lost in space
bowman reported that he ejected the others after they died in hibernation and we can be sure that he did
there can t be anyone here
besides it s so cold he almost added like a morgue but checked himself in time
but suppose whispered brailovsky just suppose bowman managed to get back to the ship and died here there was an even longer silence before curnow deliberately and slowly opened his own faceplate
he winced as the freezing air bit into his lungs then wrinkled his nose in disgust
i see what you mean
but you re letting your imagination run away with you
i ll bet you ten to one that smell comes from the galley
probably some meat went bad before the ship froze up
and bowman must have been too busy to be a good housekeeper
i ve known bachelor apartments that smelled as bad as this maybe you re right
i hope you are of course i am
and even if i m not dammit what difference does it make
we ve got a job to do max
if dave bowman s still here that s not our department is it katerina there was no reply from the surgeon commander they had gone too far inside the ship for radio to penetrate
they were indeed on their own but max s spirits were rapidly reviving
it was a privilege he decided to work with walter
the american engineer sometimes appeared soft and easygoing
but he was totally competent and when necessary as hard as nails
together they would bring discovery back to life and perhaps back to earth
19 operation windmill when discovery suddenly lit up like the proverbial christmas tree navigation and interior lights blazing from end to end the cheer aboard leonov might almost have been heard across the vacuum between the two ships
it turned into an ironic groan when the lights promptly went out again
nothing else happened for half an hour then the observation windows of discovery s flight deck began to glow with the soft crimson of the emergency lights
a few minutes later curnow and brailovsky could be seen moving around inside their figures blurred by the film of sulphur dust
hello max walter can you hear us called tanya orlova
both the figures waved instantly but made no other reply
obviously they were too busy to engage in casual conversation the watchers on leonov had to wait patiently while various lights flashed on and off one of the three pod bay doors slowly opened and quickly closed and the main antenna slewed around a modest ten degrees
hello leonov said curnow at last
sorry to keep you waiting but we ve been rather busy here s a quick assessment judging from what we ve seen so far
the ship s in much better shape than i feared
hull s intact leakage negligible air pressure eighty five per cent nominal
quite breathable but we ll have to do a major recycling job because it stinks to high heaven
the best news is that the power systems are okay
main reactor stable batteries in good shape
almost all the circuit breakers were open they d jumped or been thrown by bowman before he left so all vital equipment s been safeguarded
but it will be a very big job checking everything before we have full power again how long will that take at least for the essential systems life support propulsion hard to say skipper
how long before we crash minimum present prediction is ten days
but you know how that s changed up and down well if we don t run into any major snags we can haul discovery up to a stable orbit away from this hellhole oh i d say inside a week anything you need no max and i are doing fine
we re going into the carousel now to check the bearings
i want to get it running as soon as possible pardon me walter but is that important
gravity s convenient but we ve managed without any for quite a while i m not after gravity though it will be useful to have some aboard
if we can get the carousel running again it will mop up the ship s spin stop it tumbling
then we ll be able to couple our airlocks together and cut out evas
that will make work a hundred times easier nice idea walter but you re not going to mate my ship to that windmill
suppose the bearings seize up and the carousel jams
that would tear us to pieces agreed
we ll cross that bridge when we come to it
i ll report again as soon as i can no one had much rest for the next two days
by the end of that time curnow and brailovsky had practically fallen asleep in their suits but had completed their survey of discovery and found no unpleasant surprises
both the space agency and the state department were relieved by the preliminary report it allowed them to claim with some justification that discovery was not a derelict but a temporarily decommissioned united states spacecraft
now the task of reconditioning had to begin
once power had been restored the next problem was the air even the most thorough housecleaning operations had failed to remove the stink
curnow had been right in identifying its source as food spoiled when refrigeration had failed he also claimed with mock seriousness that it was quite romantic
i ve only got to close my eyes he asserted and i feel i m back on an old time whaling ship
can you imagine what the pequod must have smelled like it was unanimously agreed that after a visit to discovery very little effort of the imagination was required
the problem was finally solved or at least reduced to manageable proportions by dumping the ship s atmosphere
fortunately there was still enough air in the reserve tanks to replace it
one piece of very welcome news was that ninety per cent of the propellant needed for the return journey was still available choosing ammonia instead of hydrogen as working fluid for the plasma drive had paid off handsomely
the more efficient hydrogen would have boiled off into space years ago despite the insulation of the tanks and the frigid temperature outside
but almost all the ammonia had remained safely liquified and there was enough to get the ship back to a safe orbit around the earth
or at least around the moon
checking discovery s propellerlike spin was perhaps the most critical step in getting the ship under control
sasha kovalev compared curnow and brailovsky to don quixote and sancho panza and expressed the hope that their windmill tilting expedition would end more successfully
very cautiously with many pauses for checking power was fed to the carousel motors and the great drum was brought up to speed reabsorbing the spin it had long ago imparted to the ship
discovery executed a complex series of precessions until eventually its end over end tumble had almost vanished
the last traces of unwanted rotation were neutralized by the attitude control jets until the two ships were floating motionless side by side the squat stocky leonov dwarfed by the long slender discovery
transfer from one to the other was now safe and easy but captain orlova still refused to permit a physical linkup
everyone agreed with this decision for io was coming steadily closer they might yet have to abandon the vessel they had worked so hard to save
the fact that they now knew the reason for discovery s mysterious orbital decay did not help in the least
every time the ship passed between jupiter and io it sliced through the invisible flux tube linking the two bodies the electric river flowing from world to world
the resulting eddy currents induced in the ship were continually slowing it down braking it once every revolution
there was no way to predict the final moment of impact for the current in the flux tube varied wildly according to jupiter s own inscrutable laws
sometimes there were dramatic surges of activity accompanied by spectacular electric and auroral storms around io
then the ships would lose altitude by many kilometres at the same time becoming uncomfortably hot before their thermal control systems could readjust
this unexpected effect had scared and surprised everyone before the obvious explanation was realized
any form of braking produces heat somewhere the heavy currents induced in the hulls of leonov and discovery turned them briefly into low powered electric furnaces
it was not surprising that some of discovery s food supply had been ruined during the years the ship had been alternately cooked and cooled
the festering landscape of io looking more than ever like an illustration from a medical textbook was only five hundred kilometres away when curnow risked activating the main drive while leonov stood off at a very respectful distance
there were no visible effects none of the smoke and fire of the old time chemical rockets but the two ships drew slowly apart as discovery gained speed
after a few hours of very gentle manoeuvring both ships had raised themselves a thousand kilometres now there was time to relax briefly and to make plans for the next stage in the mission
you ve done a wonderful job walter said surgeon commander rudenko putting her ample arm around the exhausted curnow s shoulders
we re all proud of you very casually she broke a small capsule under his nose
it was twenty four hours before he woke up annoyed and hungry
2 guillotine what is it asked curnow with mild distaste hefting the little mechanism in his hand
a guillotine for mice not a bad description but i m after bigger game floyd pointed to a flashing arrow on the display screen which was now showing a complicated circuit diagram
you see this line yes the main power supply
so this is the point where it enters hal s central processing unit
i d like you to install this gadget here
inside the cable trunking where it can t be found without a deliberate search i see
a remote control so you can pull the plug on hal whenever you want to
very neat and a non conducting blade too so there won t be any embarrassing shorts when it s triggered
who makes toys like this
the cia never mind
the control s in my room that little red calculator i always keep on my desk
put in nine nines take the square root and press tnt
that s all
i m not sure of its range we ll have to test that but as long as leonov and discovery are within a couple of kilometres of each other there ll be no danger of hal running amok again who are you going to tell about this thing well the only person i m really hiding it from is chandra i guessed as much but the fewer who know the less likely it is to be talked about
i ll tell tanya that it exists and if there s an emergency you can show her how to operate it what kind of emergency that s not a very bright question walter
if i knew i wouldn t need the damn thing guess you re right
when do you want me to install your patented hal zapper as soon as you can
preferably tonight
when chandra s sleeping are you kidding
i don t think he ever sleeps
he s like a mother nursing a sick baby well he s got to come back to leonov to eat occasionally i ve news for you
the last time he went across he tied a little sack of rice to his suit
that will keep him going for weeks then we ll have to use one of katerina s famous knockout drops
they did a pretty good job on you didn t they curnow was joking about chandra at least floyd assumed that he was though one could never be quite sure he was fond of making outrageous statements with a perfectly straight face
it had been some time before the russians had fully realized that soon in self defence they were prone to pre emptive laughs even when curnow was being perfectly serious
curnow s own laugh mercifully had much abated since floyd had first heard it in the upward bound shuttle on that occasion it had obviously been primed by alcohol
he had fully expected to cringe from it again at the end of orbit party when leonov had finally made rendezvous with discovery
but even on that occasion though curnow had drunk a good deal he had remained as much under control as captain orlova herself
the one thing he did take seriously was his work
on the way up from earth he had been a passenger
now he was crew
21 resurrection we are floyd told himself about to awaken a sleeping giant
how will hal react to our presence after all these years
what will he remember of the past and will he be friendly or hostile
as he floated just behind dr chandra in the zero gravity environment of discovery s flight deck floyd s mind was seldom far from the cut off switch installed and tested only a few hours earlier
the radio control was mere centimetres from his hand and he felt somewhat foolish to have brought it with him
at this stage hal was still disconnected from all the ship s operational circuits
even if he was reactivated he would be a brain without limbs though not without sense organs
he would be able to communicate but not to act
as curnow had put it the worst he can do is swear at us i m ready for the first test captain said chandra
all the missing modules have been replaced and i ve run diagnostic programs on all circuits
everything appears normal at least on this level captain orlova glanced at floyd who gave a nod
at chandra s insistence only the three of them were present for this critical first run and it was quite obvious that even this small audience was unwelcome
very well dr chandra ever conscious of protocol the captain added quickly dr floyd has given his approval and i have no objections myself i should explain said chandra in a tone that clearly conveyed disapproval that his voice recognition and speech synthesis centres have been damaged
we ll have to teach him to speak all over again
luckily he learns several million times faster than a human being the scientist s fingers danced over the keyboard as he typed out a dozen words apparently at random carefully pronouncing each one as it appeared on the screen
like a distorted echo the words came back from the speaker grille lifeless indeed mechanical with no sense of any intelligence behind them
this isn t the old hal thought floyd
it s no better than the primitive speaking toys that were such a novelty when i was a kid
chandra pressed the repeat button and the series of words sounded once again
already there was a noticeable improvement though no one could have mistaken the speaker for a human being
the words i gave him contain the basic english phonemes about ten iterations and he ll be acceptable
but i don t have the equipment to do a really good job of therapy therapy asked floyd
you mean that he s well brain damaged no snapped chandra
the logic circuits are in perfect condition
only the voice output may be defective though it will improve steadily
so check everything against the visual display to avoid misinterpretations
and when you do speak enunciate carefully floyd gave captain orlova a wry smile and asked the obvious question
what about all the russian accents around here i m sure that won t be a problem with captain orlova and dr kovalev
but with the others well we ll have to run individual tests
anyone who can t pass will have to use the keyboard that s still looking a long way ahead
for the present you re the only person who should attempt communication
agreed captain absolutely only the briefest of nods revealed that dr chandra had heard them
his fingers continued to fly over the keyboard and columns of words and symbols flashed across the display screen at such a rate that no human being could possibly assimilate them
presumably chandra had an eidetic memory for he appeared to recognize whole pages of information at a glance
floyd and orlova were just about to leave the scientist to his arcane devotions when he suddenly acknowledged their presence again holding up his hand in warning or anticipation
with an almost hesitant movement in marked contrast with his previous swift actions he slid back a locking bar and pressed a single isolated key
instantly with no perceptible pause a voice came from the console no longer in a mechanical parody of human speech
there was intelligence consciousness self awareness here though as yet only on a rudimentary level
good morning dr chandra this is hal
i am ready for my first lesson there was a moment of shocked silence then acting on the same impulse the two observers left the deck
heywood floyd would never have believed it
dr chandra was crying
iv lagrange 22 big brother what delightful news about the baby dolphin
i can just imagine how excited chris was when the proud parents brought it into the house
you should have heard the ohs and ahs of my shipmates when they saw the videos of them swimming together and chris riding on its back
they suggest we call it sputnik which means companion as well as satellite
sorry it s been quite a while since my last message but the newscasts will have given you an idea of the huge job we ve had to do
even captain tanya s given up all pretence of a regular schedule each problem has to be fixed as it comes along by whoever is on the spot
we sleep when we can t stay awake any longer
i think we can all be proud of what we ve done
both ships are operational and we ve nearly finished our first round of tests on hal
in a couple of days we ll know if we can trust him to fly discovery when we leave here to make our final rendezvous with big brother
i don t know who first gave it that name the russians understandably aren t keen on it
and they ve waxed quite sarcastic about our official designation tma 2 pointing out to me several times that it s the best part of a billion kilometres from tycho
also that bowman reported no magnetic anomaly and that the only resemblance to tma 1 is the shape
when i asked them what name they preferred they came up with zagadka which means enigma
it s certainly an excellent name but everyone smiles when i try to pronounce it so i ll stick to big brother
whatever you call the thing it s only ten thousand kilometres away now and the trip won t take more than a few hours
but that last lap has us all nervous i don t mind telling you
we d hoped that we might find some new information aboard discovery
that s been our only disappointment though we should have expected it
hal of course was disconnected long before the encounter and so has no memories of what happened bowman has taken all his secrets with him
there s nothing in the ship s log and automatic recording systems that we didn t already know
the only new item we discovered was purely personal a message that bowman had left for his mother
i wonder why he never sent it obviously he did expect or hope to return to the ship after that last eva
of course we ve had it forwarded to mrs bowman she s in a nursing home somewhere in florida and her mental condition is poor so it may not mean anything to her
well that s all the news this time
i can t tell you how much i miss you and the blue skies and green seas of earth
all the colours here are reds and oranges and yellows often as beautiful as the most fantastic sunset but after a while one grows sick for the cool pure rays at the other end of the spectrum
my love to you both i ll call again just as soon as i can 23 rendezvous nikolai temovsky leonov s control and cybernetics expert was the only man aboard who could talk to dr chandra on something like his own terms
although hal s principal creator and mentor was reluctant to admit anyone into his full confidence sheer physical exhaustion had forced him to accept help
russian and indo american had formed a temporary alliance which functioned surprisingly well
most of the credit for this went to the good natured nikolai who was somehow able to sense when chandra really needed him and when he preferred to be alone
the fact that nikolai s english was much the worst on the ship was totally unimportant since most of the time both men spoke a computerese wholly unintelligible to anyone else
after a week s slow and careful reintegration all of hal s routine supervisory functions were operating reliably
he was like a man who could walk carry out simple orders do unskilled jobs and engage in low level conversation
in human terms he had an intelligence quotient of perhaps 5 only the faintest outlines of his original personality had yet emerged
he was still sleepwalking nevertheless in chandra s expert opinion he was now quite capable of flying discovery from its close orbit around io up to the rendezvous with big brother
the prospect of getting an extra seven thousand kilometres away from the burning hell beneath them was welcomed by everyone
trivial though that distance was in astronomical terms it meant that the sky would no longet be dominated by a landscape that might have been imagined by dante or hieronymus bosch
and although not even the most violent eruptions had blasted any material up to the ships there was always the fear that io might attempt to set a new record
as it was visibility from leonov s observation deck was steadily degraded by a thin film of sulphur and sooner or later someone would have to go out and clean it off
only curnow and chandra were aboard discovery when hal was given the first control of the ship
it was a very limited form of control he was merely repeating the program that had been fed into his memory and monitoring its execution
and the human crew was monitoring him if any malfunction occurred they would take over immediately
the first burn lasted for ten minutes then hal reported that discovery had entered the transfer orbit
as soon as leonov s radar and optical tracking confirmed that the other ship injected itself into the same trajectory
two minor in course corrections were made then three hours and fifteen minutes later both arrived uneventfully at the first lagrange point l 1 1 5 kilometres up on the invisible line connecting the centres of io and jupiter
hal had behaved impeccably and chandra showed unmistakable traces of such purely human emotions as satisfaction and even joy
but by that time everyone s thoughts were elsewhere big brother alias zagadka was only a hundred kilometres away
even from that distance it already appeared larger than the moon as seen from earth and shockingly unnatural in its straight edged geometrical perfection
against the background of space it would have been completely invisible but the scudding jovian clouds 35 kilometres below showed it up in dramatic relief
they also produced an illusion that once experienced the mind found almost impossible to refute
because there was no way in which its real location could be judged by the eye big brother often looked like a yawning trapdoor set in the face of jupiter
there was no reason to suppose that a hundred kilometres would be safer than ten or more dangerous than a thousand it merely seemed psychologically right for a first reconnaissance
from that distance the ship s telescopes could have revealed details only centimetres across but there were none to be seen
big brother appeared completely featureless which for an object that had presumably survived millions of years of bombardment by space debris was incredible
when floyd stared through the binocular eyepiece it seemed to him that he could reach out and touch those smooth ebon surfaces just as he had done on the moon years ago
that first time it had been with the gloved hand of his spacesuit
not until the tycho monolith had been enclosed in a pressurized dome had he been able to use his naked hand
that had made no difference he did not feel that he had ever really touched tma 1
the tips of his fingers had seemed to skitter over an invisible barrier and the harder he pushed the greater the repulsion grew
he wondered if big brother would produce the same effect
yet before they came that close they had to make every test they could devise and report their observations to earth
they were in much the same position as explosives experts trying to defuse a new type of bomb which might be detonated by the slightest false move
for all that they could tell even the most delicate of radar probes might trigger some unimaginable catastrophe
for the first twenty four hours they did nothing except observe with passive instruments telescopes cameras sensors on every wavelength
vasili orlov also took the opportunity of measuring the slab s dimensions with the greatest possible precision and confirmed the famous 1 4 9 ratio to six decimal places
big brother was exactly the same shape as tma 1 but as it was more than two kilometres long it was 718 times larger than its small sibling
and there was a second mathematical mystery
men had been arguing for years over that 1 4 9 ratio the squares of the first three integers
that could not possibly be a coincidence now here was another number to conjure with
back on earth statisticians and mathematical physicists were soon playing happily with their computers trying to relate the ratio to the fundamental constants of nature the velocity of light the proton electron mass ratio the fine structure constant
they were quickly joined by a gaggle of numerologists astrologers and mystics who threw in the height of the great pyramid the diameter of stonehenge the azimuth bearings of the nazca lines the latitude of easter island and a host of other factors from which they were able to draw the most amazing conclusions about the future
they were not in the least deterred when a celebrated washington humorist claimed that his calculations proved that the world ended on 31 december 1999 but that everyone had had too much of a hangover to notice
nor did big brother appear to notice the two ships that had arrived in its vicinity even when they cautiously probed it with radar beams and bombarded it with strings of radio pulses which it was hoped would encourage any intelligent listener to answer in the same fashion
after two frustrating days with the approval of mission control the ships halved their distance
from fifty kilometres the largest face of the slab appeared about four times the width of the moon in earth s sky impressive but not so large as to be psychologically overwhelming
it could not yet compete with jupiter ten times larger still and already the mood of the expedition was changing from awed alertness to a certain impatience
walter curnow spoke for almost everyone big brother may be willing to wait a few million years we d like to get away a little sooner 24 reconnaissance discovery had left earth with three of the little space pods that allowed an astronaut to perform extravehicular activities in shirt sleeve comfort
one had been lost in the accident if it was an accident that had killed frank poole
another had carried dave bowman to his final appointment with big brother and shared whatever fate befell him a third was still in the ship s garage the pod bay
it lacked one important component the hatch blown off by commander bowman when he had made his hazardous vacuum crossing and entered the ship through the emergency airlock after hal had refused to open the pod bay door
the resulting blast of air had rocketed the pod several hundred kilometres away before bowman busy with more important matters had brought it back under radio control
it was not surprising that he had never bothered to replace the missing hatch
now pod number 3 on which max refusing all explanations had stencilled the name nina was being prepared for another eva
it still lacked a hatch but that was unimportant
no one would be riding inside
bowman s devotion to duty was a piece of unexpected luck and it would have been folly not to take advantage of it
by using nina as a robot probe big brother could be examined at close quarters without risking human lives
that at least was the theory no one could rule out the possibility of a backlash that might engulf the ship
after all fifty kilometres was not even a hair s breadth as cosmic distances went
after years of neglect nina looked distinctly shabby
the dust that was always floating around in zero gee had settled over the outer surface so that the once immaculately white hull had become a dingy grey
as it slowly accelerated away from the ship its external manipulators folded neatly back and its oval viewport staring spaceward like a huge dead eye it did not seem a very impressive ambassador of mankind
but that was a distinct advantage so humble an emissary might be tolerated and its small size and low velocity should emphasize its peaceful intentions
there had been a suggestion that it should approach big brother with open hands the idea was quickly turned down when almost everyone agreed that if they saw nina heading toward them mechanical claws outstretched they would run for their lives
after a leisurely two hour trip nina came to rest a hundred metres from one corner of the huge rectangular slab
from so close at hand there was no sense of its true shape the tv cameras might have been looking down on the tip of a black tetrahedron of indefinite size
the onboard instruments showed no sign of radioactivity or magnetic fields nothing whatsoever was coming from big brother except the tiny fraction of sunlight it condescended to reflect
after five minutes pause the equivalent it was intended of hello here i am nina started a diagonal crossing of the smaller face then the next larger and finally the largest keeping at a distance of about fifty metres but occasionally coming in to five
whatever the separation big brother looked exactly the same smooth and featureless
long before the mission was completed it had become boring and the spectators on both ships had gone back to their various jobs only glancing at the monitors from time to time
that s it said walter curnow at last when nina had arrived back where she had started
we could spend the rest of our lives doing this without learning anything more
what do i do with nina bring her home no said vasili breaking into the circuit from aboard leonov
i ve a suggestion
take her to the exact centre of the big face
bring her to rest oh a hundred metres away
and leave her parked there with the radar switched to maximum precision no problem except that there s bound to be some residual drift
but what s the point i ve just remembered an exercise from one of my college astronomy courses the gravitational attraction of an infinite flat plate
i never thought i d have a chance of using it in real life
after i ve studied nina s movements for a few hours at least i ll be able to calculate zagadka s mass that is if it has any
i m beginning to think there s nothing really there there s an easy way to settle that and we ll have to do it eventually
nina must go in and touch the thing she already has what do you mean asked curnow rather indignantly
i never got nearer than five metres i m not criticizing your driving skills though it was a pretty close thing at that first corner wasn t it
but you ve been tapping gently on zagadka every time you use nina s thrusters near its surface a flea jumping on an elephant perhaps
we simply don t know
but we d better assume that one way or another it s aware of our presence and will only tolerate us as long as we aren t a nuisance he left the unspoken question hanging in the air
how did one annoy a two kilometre long black rectangular slab
and just what form would its disapproval take
25 the view from lagrange astronomy was full of such intriguing but meaningless coincidences
the most famous was the fact that from the earth both sun and moon have the same apparent diameter
here at the l 1 libration point which big brother had chosen for its cosmic balancing act on the gravitational tightrope between jupiter and io a similar phenomenon occurred
planet and satellite appeared exactly the same size
and what a size
not the miserable half degree of sun and moon but forty times their diameter sixteen hundred times their area
the sight of either was enough to fill the mind with awe and wonder together the spectacle was overwhelming
every forty two hours they would go through their complete cycle of phases when io was new jupiter was full and vice versa
but even when the sun was hiding behind jupiter and the planet presented only its nightside it was unmistakably there a huge black disk eclipsing the stars
sometimes that blackness would be momentarily rent by lightning flashes lasting for many seconds from electrical storms far larger than the earth
on the opposite side of the sky always keeping the same face toward its giant master io would be a sluggishly boiling cauldron of reds and oranges with occasional yellow clouds erupting from one of its volcanoes and falling swiftly back to the surface
like jupiter but on a slightly longer time scale io was a world without geography
its face was remodelled in a matter of decades jupiter s in a matter of days
as io waned toward its last quarter so the vast intricately banded jovian cloudscape would light up beneath the tiny distant sun
sometimes the shadow of io itself or one of the outer satellites would drift across the face of jupiter while every revolution would show the planet sized vortex of the great red spot a hurricane that had endured for centuries if not for millennia
poised between such wonders the crew of leonov had material for lifetimes of research but the natural objects of the jovian system were at the very bottom of their list of priorities
big brother was number 1 though the ships had now moved in to only five kilometres tanya still refused to allow any direct physical contact
i m going to wait she said until we re in a position to make a quick getaway
we ll sit and watch until our launch window opens
then we ll consider our next move it was true that nina had finally grounded on big brother after a leisurely fifty minute fall
this had allowed vasili to calculate the object s mass as a surprisingly low 95 tons which gave it about the density of air
presumably it was hollow which provoked endless speculation about what might be inside
but there were plenty of practical everyday problems to take their minds off these greater issues
housekeeping chores aboard leonov and discovery absorbed ninety per cent of their working time though operations were much more efficient since the two ships had been coupled by a flexible docking connection
curnow had finally convinced tanya that discovery s carousel would not suddenly seize up and tear the ships to pieces so it had become possible to move freely from one vessel to the other merely by opening and closing two sets of airtight doors
spacesuits and time consuming evas were no longer necessary to the great delight of everyone except max who loved going outside and exercising with his broomstick
the two crew members quite unaffected by this were chandra and ternovsky who now virtually lived aboard discovery and worked around the clock continuing their apparently endless dialogue with hal
when will you be ready they were asked at least once a day
they refused to make any promises hal remained a low grade moron
then a week after the rendezvous with big brother chandra unexpectedly announced we re ready only the two lady medics were absent from discovery s flight deck and that was merely because there was no room for them they were watching on leonov s monitors
floyd stood immediately behind chandra his hand never far from what curnow with his usual gift for the neat phrase had called his pocket giant killer
let me emphasize again said chandra that there must be no talking
your accents will confuse him i can speak but no one else
is that understood chandra looked and sounded at the edge of exhaustion
yet his voice held a note of authority that no one had ever heard before
tanya might be the boss everywhere else but he was master there
the audience some anchored to convenient handholds some floating freely nodded assent
chandra closed an audio switch and said quietly but clearly good morning hal an instant later it seemed to floyd that the years had rolled away
it was no longer a simple electronic toy that answered back
hal had returned
good morning dr chandra do you feel capable of resuming your duties of course
i am completely operational and all my circuits are functioning perfectly then do you mind if i ask you a few questions not at all do you recall a failure of the ae 35 antenna control unit certainly not despite chandra s injunction there was a little gasp from the listeners
this is like tiptoeing through a minefield thought floyd as he patted the reassuring shape of the radio cut off
if that line of questioning triggered another psychosis he could kill hal in a second
he knew having rehearsed the procedure a dozen times
but a second was aeons to a computer that was a chance they would have to take
you do not remember either dave bowman or frank poole going out to replace the ae 35 unit no
that could not have happened or i would have remembered it
where are frank and dave
who are these people
i can only identify you though i compute a sixty five per cent probability that the man behind you is dr heywood floyd remembering chandra s strict injunction floyd refrained from congratulating hal
after a decade sixty five per cent was a pretty good score
many humans would not have done so well
don t worry hal i will explain everything later has the mission been completed
you know i have the greatest enthusiasm for it the mission has been completed you have carried out your program
now if you will excuse us we wish to have a private conversation certainly chandra switched off sound and vision inputs to the main console
as far as this part of the ship was concerned hal was now deaf and blind
well what was all that about demanded vasili orlov
it means said chandra carefully and precisely that i have erased all hal s memories beginning at the moment when the trouble started that sounds quite a feat marvelled sasha
how did you do it i am afraid it would take me longer to explain than it did to carry out the operation chandra i am a computer expert though not in the same class as you and nikolai
the 9 series uses holographic memories doesn t it
so you couldn t have used a simple chronological erasure
it must have been some kind of tapeworm homing on selected words and concepts tapeworm said katerina over the ship s intercom
i thought that was my department though i m glad to say i ve never seen one of the beastly things outside a jar of alcohol
what are you talking about computer jargon katerina
in the old days the very old days they really did use magnetic tape
and it s possible to construct a program that can be fed into a system to hunt down and destroy eat if you like any desired memories
can t you do the same sort of thing to human beings by hypnosis yes but it can always be reversed
we never really forget anything
we only think we do a computer doesn t work that way
when it s told to forget something it does
the information is completely erased so hal has absolutely no memory of his misbehaviour i cannot be a hundred per cent certain of that answered chandra
there may be some memories that were in transit from one address to another when the tapeworm was making its search
but this is very unlikely fascinating said tanya after everyone had thought this over in silence for some time
but the much more important question is can he be relied upon in future before chandra could answer floyd anticipated him
the same set of circumstances can never arise again i can promise you that
the whole trouble started because it s difficult to explain security to a computer or to human beings muttered curnow not very sotto voce
i hope you re right said tanya without much conviction
what s the next step chandra nothing so tricky merely long and tedious
now we have to program him to initiate the jupiter escape sequence and to bring discovery home
three years after we ve got back on our high speed orbit 26 probation to victor millson chairman national council on astronautics washington from heywood floyd aboard ussc discovery subject malfunction of onboard computer hal 9 classification secret dr chandrasegarampillai hereinafter referred to as dr c has now completed his preliminary examination of hal
he has restored all missing modules and the computer appears to be fully operational
details of dr c s actions and conclusions will be found in the report he and dr ternovsky will submit shortly
meanwhile you have asked me to summarize them in non technical terms for the benefit of the council especially the new members who will not be familiar with the background
frankly i doubt my ability to do this as you know i am not a computer specialist
but i will do my best
the problem was apparently caused by a conflict between hal s basic instructions and the requirements of security
by direct presidential order the existence of tma 1 was kept a complete secret
only those with a need to know were permitted access to the information
discovery s mission to jupiter was already in the advanced planning stage when tma 1 was excavated and radiated its signal to that planet
as the function of the prime crew bowman
poole was merely to get the vessel to its destination it was decided that they should not be informed of its new objective
by training the investigative team kaminski hunter whitehead separately and placing them in hibernation before the voyage began it was felt that a much higher degree of security would be attained as the danger of leaks accidental or otherwise would be greatly reduced
i would like to remind you that at the time my memorandum nca 342 23 top secret of 1 4 3 i pointed out several objections to this policy
however they were overruled at a higher level
as hal was capable of operating the ship without human assistance it was also decided that he should be programmed to carry out the mission autonomously in the event of the crew s being incapacitated or killed
he was therefore given full knowledge of its objectives but was not permitted to reveal them to bowman or poole
this situation conflicted with the purpose for which hal had been designed the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment
as a result hal developed what would be called in human terms a psychosis specifically schizophrenia
dr c informs me that in technical terminology hal became trapped in a hofstadter moebius loop a situation apparently not uncommon among advanced computers with autonomous goal seeking programs
he suggests that for further information you contact professor hofstadter himself
to put it crudely if i understand dr c hal was faced with an intolerable dilemma and so developed paranoiac symptoms that were directed against those monitoring his performance back on earth
he accordingly attempted to break the radio link with mission control first by reporting a non existent fault in the ae 35 antenna unit
this involved him not only in a direct lie which must have aggravated his psychosis still further but also in a confrontation with the crew
presumably we can only guess at this of course he decided that the only way out of the situation was to eliminate his human colleagues which he very nearly succeeded in doing
looking at the matter purely objectively it would have been interesting to see what would have happened had he continued the mission alone without man made interference
this is virtually all i have been able to learn from dr c i do not like to question him further as he is working to the point of exhaustion
but even allowing for this fact i must frankly state and please keep this absolutely confidential that dr c is not always as cooperative as he should be
he adopts a defensive attitude toward hal which sometimes makes it extremely difficult to discuss the subject
even dr ternovsky who might have been expected to be a little more independent often appears to share this viewpoint
however the only really important question is can hal be relied upon in the future
dr c of course has no doubts on the matter
he claims to have obliterated all the computer s memories of the traumatic events leading up to the disconnection
nor does he believe that hal can suffer from anything remotely analogous to the human sense of guilt
in any case it seems impossible that the situation that caused the original problem can ever arise again
although hal suffers from a number of peculiarities they are not of a nature that would cause any apprehension they are merely minor annoyances some of them even amusing
and as you know but dr c does not i have taken steps that will give us complete control as a last resort
to sum up the rehabilitation of hal 9 is proceeding satisfactorily
one might even say that he is on probation
i wonder if he knows it
27 interlude true confessions the human mind has an astonishing capacity to adapt after a while even the incredible becomes commonplace
there were times when the crew of leonov switched off their surroundings perhaps in an unconscious move to preserve sanity
dr heywood floyd often thought that on such occasions walter curnow worked a little too hard at being the life and soul of the party
and though he triggered what sasha kovalev later called the true confessions episode he certainly had not planned anything of the sort
it arose spontaneously when he voiced the universal dissatisfaction with almost all aspects of zero gravity plumbing
if i could have one wish granted he exclaimed during the daily six o clock soviet it would be to soak in a nice foaming bathtub scented with essence of pine and with just my nose above the waterline when the murmurs of assent and sighs of frustrated desire had died away katerina rudenko took up the challenge
how splendidly decadent walter she beamed at him with cheerful disapproval
it makes you sound like a roman emperor
if i were back on earth i d like something more active such as umm am i allowed to go back in time as well if you like when i was a girl i used to go for holidays to a collective farm in georgia
there was a beautiful palomino stallion bought by the director out of the money he d made on the local black market
he was an old scoundrel but i loved him and he used to let me gallop alexander all over the countryside
i might have been killed but that s the memory that brings earth back to me more than anything else there was a moment of thoughtful silence then curnow asked any other volunteers everyone seemed so lost in their own memories that the game might have ended there had not maxim brailovsky started it off again
i d like to be diving that was just about my favourite hobby when i had time for one and i was glad i could keep it up through my cosmonaut training
i ve dived off pacific atolls the great barrier reef the red sea coral reefs are the most beautiful places in the world
yet the experience i remember best was in quite a different place one of the japanese kelp forests
it was like an underwater cathedral with sunlight slanting through those enormous leaves
mysterious magical
i ve never been back perhaps it wouldn t be the same the next time
but i d like to try fine said walter who as usual had appointed himself master of ceremonies
who s next i ll give you a quick answer said tanya orlova
the bolshoi swan lake
but vasili won t agree
he hates ballet that makes two of us
anyway what would you select vasili i was going to say diving but max beat me to it
so i ll go in the opposite direction gliding
soaring through the clouds on a summer day in complete silence
well not quite complete the airflow over the wing can get noisy especially when you re banking
that s the way to enjoy earth like a bird zenia easy
skiing in the pamirs
i love snow and you chandra the atmosphere changed noticeably when walter put the question
after all this time chandra was still a stranger perfectly polite even courteous but never revealing himself
when i was a boy he said slowly my grandfather took me on a pilgrimage to varanasi benares
if you ve never been there i m afraid you won t understand
to me to many indians even nowadays whatever their religion it s the centre of the world
one day i plan to go back and you nikolai well we ve had the sea and sky
i d like to combine both
my favourite sport used to be wind surfing
i m afraid i m too old for it now but i d like to find out that only leaves you woody
what s your choice floyd did not even stop to think his spontaneous answer surprised himself as much as the others
i don t mind where on earth i am as long as i m with my little son after that there was no more to be said
the session was over
28 frustration you ve seen all the technical reports dimitri so you ll understand our frustration
we ve learned nothing new from all our tests and measurements
zagadka just sits there filling half the sky ignoring us completely
yet it can t be inert an abandoned space derelict
vasili has pointed out that it must be taking some positive action to remain here at the unstable libration point
otherwise it would have drifted away ages ago just as discovery did and crashed into io
so what do we do next
we wouldn t have nuclear explosives on board would we in contravention of un 8 para 3
i m only joking
now that we re under less pressure and the launch window for the homeward trip is still weeks away there s a distinct feeling of boredom as well as frustration
don t laugh i can imagine how that sounds to you back in moscow
how could any intelligent person get bored out here surrounded by the greatest marvels human eyes have ever seen
yet there s no doubt of it
morale isn t what it was
until now we ve all been disgustingly healthy
now almost everyone has a minor cold or an upset stomach or a scratch that won t heal despite all of katerina s pills and powders
she s given up now and just swears at us
sasha has helped to keep us amused with a series of bulletins on the ship s bulletin board
their theme is stamp out russlish
and he lists horrid mixtures of both languages he claims to have overheard wrong uses of words and so forth
we ll all need linguistic decontamination when we get home several times i ve come across your countrymen chatting in english without even being aware of it lapsing into their native tongue only for difficult words
the other day i caught myself talking russian to walter curnow and neither of us noticed for several minutes
there was one bit of unscheduled activity the other day that will tell you something about our state of mind
the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night triggered by one of the smoke detectors
well it turned out that chandra had smuggled some of his lethal cigars aboard and couldn t resist temptation anymore
he was smoking one in the toilet like a guilty schoolboy
of course he was horribly embarrassed everyone else thought it hysterically funny after the initial panic
you know the way some perfectly trivial joke which doesn t mean a thing to outsiders can sweep through a group of otherwise intelligent people and reduce them to helpless laughter
one had only to pretend to light a cigar for the next few days and everybody would go to pieces
what makes it even more ridiculous is that no one would have minded in the least if chandra had just gone into an airlock or switched off the smoke detector
but he was too shy to admit that he had such a human weakness so now he spends even more of his time communing with hal floyd pressed the pause button and stopped the recording
perhaps it was not fair to make fun of chandra tempting though it often was
all sorts of little quirks of personality had surfaced during the last few weeks there had even been some bad quarrels for no obvious reason
and for that matter what of his own behaviour
had that always been above criticism
he was still not sure if he had handled curnow properly
though he did not suppose that he would ever really like the big engineer or enjoy the sound of his slightly too loud voice floyd s attitude toward him had changed from mere tolerance to respectful admiration
the russians adored him not least because his rendering of such favourites as polyushko polye often reduced them to tears
and in one case floyd felt that the adoration had gone a little too far
walter he had begun cautiously i m not sure if it s my business but there s a personal matter i d like to raise with you when someone says it s not his business he s usually right
what s the problem to be blunt your behaviour with max there was a frigid silence which floyd occupied with a careful inspection of the poor paintjob on the opposite wall
then curnow replied in a soft yet implacable voice i was under the distinct impression that he was more than eighteen don t confuse the issue
and frankly it s not max i m concerned about
it s zenia curnow s lips parted in unconcealed surprise
zenia
what s she got to do with it for an intelligent man you re often singularly unobservant even obtuse
surely you realize that she s in love with max
haven t you noticed the way she looks when you put your arm around him floyd had never imagined that he would see curnow looking abashed but the blow seemed to have struck home
zenia
i thought everyone was joking she s such a quiet little mouse
and everyone s in love with max after their fashion even catherine the great
still um i guess i should be more careful
at least while zenia s around there was a prolonged silence while the social temperature rose back to normal
then obviously to show that there was no ill feeling curnow added in a conversational tone you know i ve often wondered about zenia somebody did a marvellous job of plastic surgery on her face but they couldn t repair all the damage
the skin s too tight and i don t think i ve ever seen her laugh properly
maybe that s why i ve avoided looking at her would you credit me with so much aesthetic sensitivity heywood the deliberately formal heywood signalled good natured needling rather than hostility and floyd allowed himself to relax
i can satisfy some of your curiosity washington finally got hold of the facts
it seems she was in a bad air crash and was lucky to recover from her burns
there s no mystery as far as we can tell but aeroflot isn t supposed to have accidents poor girl
i m surprised they let her go into space but i suppose she was the only qualified person available when irma eliminated herself
i m sorry for her apart from the injuries the psychological shock must have been terrible i m sure it was but she s obviously made a full recovery you re not telling the whole truth said floyd to himself and you never will
after their encounter on the approach to jupiter there would always be a secret bond between them not of love but of tenderness which is often more enduring
he found himself suddenly and unexpectedly grateful to curnow the other was obviously surprised at his concern for zenia but had not attempted to exploit it in his own defence
and if he had would it have been unfair
now days later floyd was beginning to wonder if his own motives were altogether admirable
for his part curnow had certainly kept his promise indeed if one did not know better one might have imagined that he was deliberately ignoring max at least while zenia was around
and he treated her with much greater kindness indeed there were occasions when he had even succeeded in making her laugh out loud
so the intervention had been worthwhile whatever the impulse behind it
even if as floyd sometimes ruefully suspected it was no more than the secret envy that normal homo or heterosexuals feel if completely honest with themselves toward cheerfully well adjusted polymorphs
his finger crept back toward the recorder but the train of thought had been broken
inevitably images of his own home and family came crowding into his mind he closed his eyes and memory recalled the climax of christopher s birthday party the child blowing out the three candles on the cake less than twenty four hours ago but almost a billion kilometres away
he had played the video back so often that now he knew the scene by heart
and how often had caroline played his messages to chris so that the boy would not forget his father or view him as a stranger when he returned after missing yet another birthday
he was almost afraid to ask
yet he could not blame caroline
to him only a few weeks would have passed before they met again
but she would have aged more than two years while he was in his dreamless sleep between the worlds
that was a long time to be a young widow even a temporary one
i wonder if i m coming down with one of the shipboard maladies floyd thought he had seldom felt such a sense of frustration even of failure
i may have lost my family across the gulfs of time and space all to no purpose
for i have achieved nothing even though i have reached my goal it remains a blank impenetrable wall of total darkness
and yet david bowman had once cried my god
it s full of stars 29 emergence sasha s latest edict read russlish bulletin 8 subject tovarishch tovarish to our american guests frankly pals i can t remember when i was last addressed by this term
to any twenty first century russian it s way back there with the battleship potemkin a reminder of cloth caps and red flags and vladimir ilich haranguing the workers from the steps of railway carriages ever since i was a kid it s been bratets or druzhok take your choice you re welcome
comrade kovalev floyd was still chuckling over this notice when vasili orlov joined him as he floated through the lounge observation deck on his way to the bridge
what amazes me tovarishch is that sasha ever found time to study anything besides engineering physics
yet he s always quoting poems and plays i don t even know and he speaks better english than well walter because he switched to science sasha is what do you say the black sheep of the family
his father was a professor of english at novosibirsk
russian was only allowed in the house monday to wednesday thursday to saturday it was english and sundays oh french or german alternate weeks now i know exactly what you mean by nekulturny fits me like a glove
does sasha feel guilty about his defection
and with such a background why did he ever become an engineer at novosibirsk you soon learn who are the serfs and who are the aristocrats
sasha was an ambitious young man as well as a brilliant one just like you vasili et tu brute
you see i can quote shakespeare as well bozhe moi
what was that floyd was unlucky he was floating with his back to the observation window and saw nothing at all
when he twisted around seconds later there was only the familiar view of big brother bisecting the giant disk of jupiter just as it had done ever since their arrival
but to vasili for a moment that would be imprinted on his memory forever that sharp edged outline held a completely different and wholly impossible scene
it was as if a window had suddenly been opened onto another universe
the vision lasted for less than a second before his involuntary blink reflex cut it off
he was looking into a field not of stars but of suns as if into the crowded heart of a galaxy or the core of a globular cluster
in that moment vasili orlov lost forever the skies of earth
from now on they would seem intolerably empty even mighty orion and glorious scorpio would be scarcely noticeable patterns of feeble sparks not worthy of a second glance
when he dared to open his eyes again it was all gone
no not completely
at the very centre of the now restored ebon rectangle a faint star was still shining
but a star did not move as one watched
orlov blinked again to clear his watering eyes
yes the movement was real he was not imagining it
a meteor
it was some indication of chief scientist vasili orlov s state of shock that several seconds passed before he remembered that meteors were impossible in airless space
then it blurred suddenly into a streak of light and within a few heartbeats had vanished beyond the edge of jupiter
by this time vasili had recovered his wits and was once more the cool dispassionate observer
already he had a good estimate of the object s trajectory
there could be no doubt it was aimed directly at earth
v a child of the stars 3 homecoming it was as if he had awakened from a dream or a dream within a dream
the gate between the stars had brought him back to the world of men but no longer as a man
how long had he been away
a whole lifetime no two lifetimes one forward one in reverse
as david bowman commander and last surviving crew member of united states spaceship discovery he had been caught in a gigantic trap set three million years ago and triggered to respond only at the right time and to the right stimulus
he had fallen through it from one universe to another meeting wonders some of which he now understood others which he might never comprehend
he had raced at ever accelerating speed down infinite corridors of light until he had outraced light itself
that he knew was impossible but now he also knew how it could be done
as einstein had rightly said the good lord was subtle but never malicious
he had passed through a cosmic switching system a grand central station of the galaxies and emerged protected from its fury by unknown forces close to the surface of a giant red star
there he had witnessed the paradox of sunrise on the face of a sun when the dying star s brilliant white dwarf companion had climbed into its sky a searing apparition drawing a tidal wave of fire beneath it
he had felt no fear but only wonder even when his space pod had carried him down into the inferno below to arrive beyond all reason in a beautifully appointed hotel suite containing nothing that was not wholly familiar
however much of it was fake the books on the shelves were dummies the cereal boxes and the cans of beer in the icebox though they bore famous labels all contained the same bland food with a texture like bread but a taste that was almost anything he cared to imagine
he had quickly realized that he was a specimen in a cosmic zoo his cage carefully recreated from the images in old television programmes
and he wondered when his keepers would appear and in what physical form
how foolish that expectation had been
he knew now that one might as well hope to see the wind or speculate about the true shape of fire
then exhaustion of mind and body had overwhelmed him
for the last time david bowman slept
it was a strange sleep for he was not wholly unconscious
like a fog creeping through a forest something invaded his mind
he sensed it only dimly for the full impact would have destroyed him as swiftly and surely as the fires raging around him
beneath its dispassionate scrutiny he felt neither hope nor fear
sometimes in that long sleep he dreamed he was awake
years had gone by once he was looking in a mirror at a wrinkled face he barely recognized as his own
his body was racing to its dissolution the hands of the biological clock spinning madly toward a midnight they would never reach
for at the last moment time came to a halt and reversed itself
the springs of memory were being trapped in controlled recollection he was reliving his past being drained of knowledge and experience as he swept back toward his childhood
but nothing was being lost all that he had ever been at every moment of his life was being transferred to safer keeping
even as one david bowman ceased to exist another became immortal passing beyond the necessities of matter
he was an embryo god not yet ready to be born
for ages he floated in limbo knowing what he had been but not what he had become
he was still in a state of flux somewhere between chrysalis and butterfly
or perhaps only between caterpillar and chrysalis
and then the stasis was broken time re entered his little world
the black rectangular slab that suddenly appeared before him was like an old friend
he had seen it on the moon he had encountered it in orbit around jupiter and he knew somehow that his ancestors had met it long ago
though it held still unfathomed secrets it was no longer a total mystery some of its powers he now understood
he realized that it was not one but multitudes and that whatever measuring instruments might say it was always the same size as large as necessary
how obvious now was that mathematical ratio of its sides the quadratic sequence 1 4 9
and how naive to have imagined that the series ended there in only three dimensions
even as his mind focused upon these geometrical simplicities the empty rectangle filled with stars
the hotel suite if indeed it had ever really existed dissolved back into the mind of its creator and there before him was the luminous whirlpool of the galaxy
it might have been some beautiful incredibly detailed model embedded in a block of plastic
but it was the reality now grasped by him as a whole with senses more subtle than vision
if he wished he could focus his attention upon any one of its hundred billion stars
here he was adrift in this great river of suns halfway between the banked fires of the galactic core and the lonely scattered sentinel stars of the rim
and there was his origin on the far side of this chasm in the sky this serpentine band of darkness empty of all stars
he knew that this formless chaos visible only by the glow that limned its edges from fire mists far beyond was the still unused stuff of creation the raw material of evolutions yet to be
here time had not yet begun not until the suns that now burned were long since dead would light and life reshape this void
unwittingly he had crossed it once now far better prepared though still wholly ignorant of the impulse that drove him he must cross it again
the galaxy burst forth from the mental frame in which he had enclosed it stars and nebulae poured past him in an illusion of infinite speed
phantom suns exploded and fell behind as he slipped like a shadow through their cores
the stars were thinning out the glare of the milky way dimming into a pale ghost of the glory he had known and might one day know again
he was back in the space that men called real at the very point he had left it seconds or centuries ago
he was vividly aware of his surroundings and far more conscious than in that earlier existence of myriad sensory inputs from the external world
he could focus upon any one of them and scrutinize it in virtually limitless detail until he confronted the fundamental granular structure of time and space below which there was only chaos
and he could move though he did not know how
but had he ever really known that even when he possessed a body
the chain of command from brain to limb was a mystery to which he had never given any thought
an effort of will and the spectrum of that nearby star shifted toward the blue by precisely the amount he wished
he was falling toward it at a large fraction of the speed of light though he could go faster if he desired he was in no hurry
there was still much information to be processed much to be considered and much more to be won
that he knew was his present goal but he also knew that it was only part of some far wider plan to be revealed in due course
he gave no thought to the gateway between universes dwindling so swiftly behind him or to the anxious entities gathered around it in their primitive spacecraft
they were part of his memories but stronger ones were calling him now calling him home to the world he had never thought to see again
he could hear its myriad voices growing louder and louder as it too was growing from a star almost lost against the sun s outstretched corona to a slim crescent and finally to a glorious blue white disk
they knew that he was coming
down there on that crowded globe the alarms would be flashing across the radar screens the great tracking telescopes would be searching the skies and history as men had known it would be drawing to a close
he became aware that a thousand kilometres below a slumbering cargo of death had awakened and was stirring in its orbit
the feeble energies it contained were no possible menace to him indeed he could profitably use them
he entered the maze of circuitry and swiftly traced the way to its lethal core
most of the branchings could be ignored they were blind alleys devised for protection
beneath his scrutiny their purpose was childishly simple it was easy to bypass them all
now there was a single last barrier a crude but effective mechanical relay holding apart two contacts
until they were closed there would be no power to activate the final sequence
he put forth his will and for the first time knew failure and frustration
the few grams of the microswitch would not budge
he was still a creature of pure energy as yet the world of inert matter was beyond his grasp
well there was a simple answer to that
he still had much to learn
the current pulse he induced in the relay was so powerful that it almost melted the coil before it could operate the trigger mechanism
the microseconds ticked slowly by
it was interesting to observe the explosive lenses focus their energies like the feeble match that ignites a powder train which in turn the megatons flowered in a silent detonation that brought a brief false dawn to half the sleeping world
like a phoenix rising from the flames he absorbed what he needed and discarded the rest
far below the shield of the atmosphere which protected the planet from so many hazards absorbed the most dangerous of the radiation
but there would be some unlucky men and animals who would never see again
in the aftermath of the explosion it seemed as if the earth was struck dumb
the babble of the short and medium waves was completely silenced reflected back by the suddenly enhanced ionosphere
only the microwaves still sliced through the invisible and slowly dissolving mirror that now surrounded the planet and most of these were too tightly beamed for him to receive them
a few high powered radars were still focused upon him but that was a matter of no importance
he did not even bother to neutralize them as he could easily have done
and if any more bombs were to come his way he would treat them with equal indifference
for the present he had all the energy he needed
and now he was descending in great sweeping spirals toward the lost landscape of his childhood
31 disneyville a fin de siecle philosopher had once remarked and been roundly denounced for his pains that walter elias disney had contributed more to genuine human happiness than all the religious teachers in history
now half a century after the artist s death his dreams were still proliferating across the florida landscape
when it had opened in the early 198 s his experimental prototype community of tomorrow had been a showcase for new technologies and modes of living
but as its founder had realized epcot would only fulfil its purpose when some of its vast acreage was a genuine living town occupied by people who called it home
that process had taken the remainder of the century now the residential area had twenty thousand inhabitants and had inevitably become popularly known as disneyville
because they could move in only after penetrating a palace guard of wed lawyers it was not surprising that the average age of the occupants was the highest in any united states community or that its medical services were the most advanced in the world
some of them indeed could hardly have been conceived still less created in any other place
the apartment had been carefully designed not to look like a hospital suite and only a few unusual fittings would have betrayed its purpose
the bed was scarcely knee high so that the danger of falls was minimized it could however be raised and tilted for the convenience of the nurses
the bathroom tub was sunk into the floor and had a built in seat as well as handrails so that even the elderly or infirm could get in and out of it easily
the floor was thickly carpeted but there were no rugs over which one could trip or sharp corners that might cause injuries
other details were less obvious and the tv camera was so well concealed that no one would have suspected its presence
there were few personal touches a pile of old books in one corner and a framed front page of one of the last printed issues of the new york times proclaiming us spaceship leaves for jupiter
close to this were two photographs one showing a boy in his late teens the other a considerably older man wearing astronaut s uniform
though the frail grey haired woman watching the domestic comedy unfolding on the tv panel was not yet seventy she looked much older
from time to time she chuckled appreciatively at some joke from the screen but she kept glancing at the door as if expecting a visitor
and when she did so she took a firmer grasp on the walking stick propped against her chair
yet she was distracted by a moment of tv drama when the door finally opened and she looked around with a guilty start as the little service trolley rolled into the room followed closely by a uniformed nurse
time for lunch jessie called the nurse we ve got something very nice for you today don t want any lunch it will make you feel a lot better i won t eat until you tell me what it is why won t you eat it i m not hungry
are you ever hungry she added slyly
the robot food trolley came to a halt beside the chair and the transport covers opened up to reveal the dishes
throughout the nurse never touched anything not even the controls on the trolley
she now stood motionless with a rather fixed smile looking at her difficult patient
in the monitor room fifty metres away the medical technician said to the doctor now watch this jessie s gnarled hand lifted the walking stick then with surprising speed she swept it in a short arc toward the nurse s legs
the nurse took no notice whatsoever even when the stick sliced right through her
instead she remarked soothingly now doesn t that look nice
eat it up dear a cunning smile spread across jessie s face but she obeyed instructions
in a moment she was eating heartily
you see said the technician
she knows perfectly well what s going on
she s a lot brighter than she pretends to be most of the time and she s the first yes
all the others believe that really is nurse williams bringing their meals well i don t think it matters
look how pleased she is just because she s outsmarted us
she s eating her food which is the purpose of the exercise
but we must warn the nurses all of them not just williams why oh of course
the next time it may not be a hologram and then think of the lawsuits we ll be facing from our battered staff 32 crystal spring the indians and the cajun settlers who had moved here from louisiana said that crystal spring was bottomless
that of course was nonsense and surely even they could not believe it
one had only to put on a face mask and swim out a few strokes and there clearly visible was the little cave from which the incredibly pure water flowed with the slender green weeds undulating around it
and peering up through them the eyes of the monster
two dark circles side by side even though they never moved what else could they be
that lurking presence gave an added excitement to every swim one day the monster would come rushing up from its lair scattering the fish in its hunt for larger prey
never would bobby or david admit that nothing more dangerous than an abandoned and doubtless stolen bicycle lay half buried among the water weeds a hundred metres down
that depth was hard to believe even after line and sinker had established it beyond argument
bobby the older and better diver had been perhaps a tenth of the way down and had reported that the bottom looked just as far away as ever
but now the crystal spring was about to reveal its secrets perhaps the legend of the confederate treasure was true despite the scorn of all the local historians
at the very least they might endear themselves to the chief of police always excellent policy by recovering a few handguns deposited after recent crimes
the little air compressor that bobby had found in the garage junk heap was now chugging healthily away after their initial problems of starting it
every few seconds it would cough and emit a cloud of blue smoke but it showed no sign of stopping
and even if it does said bobby so what
if the girls in the underwater theatre can swim up from fifty metres without their air hoses so can we
it s perfectly safe in that case thought dave fleetingly why didn t we tell ma what we were doing and why did we wait until dad had gone back to the cape for the next shuttle launch
but he did not have any real qualms bobby always knew best
it must be wonderful to be seventeen and to know everything
though he wished he wouldn t spend quite so much time now with that stupid betty schultz
true she was very pretty but dammit she was a girl
it was only with the greatest difficulty that they had been able to get rid of her this morning
dave was used to being a guinea pig that was what younger brothers were for
he adjusted his face mask put on his flippers and slid into the crystalline water
bobby handed him the air hose with the old scuba mouthpiece they had taped to it
dave took a breath and grimaced
it tastes horrible you ll get used to it
in you go no deeper than that ledge
that s where i ll start adjusting the pressure valve so we don t waste too much air
come up when i tug the hose dave slid gently beneath the surface and into wonderland
it was a peaceful monochrome world so different from the coral reefs of the keys
there were none of the garish colours of the marine environment where life animal and vegetable flaunted itself with all the hues of the rainbow
here were only delicate shades of blue and green and fish that looked like fish not like butterflies
he flippered slowly down dragging the hose behind him pausing to drink from its stream of bubbles whenever he felt the need
the sensation of freedom was so wonderful that he almost forgot the horrible oily taste in his mouth
when he reached the ledge actually an ancient waterlogged tree trunk so overgrown with weeds that it was unrecognizable he sat down and looked around him
he could see right across the spring to the green slopes at the far side of the flooded crater at least a hundred metres away
there were not many fish around but a small school went twinkling past like a shower of silver coins in the sunlight streaming down from above
there was also an old friend stationed as usual at the gap where the waters of the spring began their journey to the sea
a small alligator but large enough bobby had once said cheerfully
he s bigger than i am was hanging vertically without visible means of support only his nose above the surface
they had never bothered him and he had never bothered them
the air hose gave an impatient tug
dave was happy to go he had not realized how cold it could get at that hitherto unattainable depth and he was also feeling distinctly sick
but the hot sunlight soon revived his spirits
no problems said bobby expansively
just keep unscrewing the valve so the pressure gauge doesn t drop below the red line how deep are you going all the way if i feel like it dave did not take that seriously they both knew about rapture of the depths and nitrogen narcosis
and in any case the old garden hose was only thirty metres long
that would be plenty for this first experiment
as he had done so many times before he watched with envious admiration as his beloved elder brother accepted a new challenge
swimming as effortlessly as the fish around him bobby glided downward into that blue mysterious universe
he turned once and pointed vigorously to the air hose making it unmistakably clear that he needed an increased air flow
despite the splitting headache that had suddenly come upon him dave remembered his duty
he hurried back to the ancient compressor and opened the control valve to its deadly maximum fifty parts per million of carbon monoxide
the last he saw of bobby was that confidently descending sunlight dappled figure passing forever beyond his reach
the wax statue in the funeral parlour was a total stranger who had nothing to do with robert bowman
33 betty why had he come here returning like an unquiet ghost to the scene of ancient anguish
he had no idea indeed he had not been conscious of his destination until the round eye of crystal spring had gazed up at him from the forest below
he was master of the world yet he was paralysed by a sense of devastating grief he had not known for years
time had healed the wound as it always does yet it seemed only yesterday that he had stood weeping beside the emerald mirror seeing only the reflections of the surrounding cypresses with their burden of spanish moss
what was happening to him
and now still without deliberate volition but as if swept by some gentle current he was drifting northward toward the state capital
he was looking for something what it was he would not know until he found it
no one and no instrument detected his passage
he was no longer radiating wastefully but had almost mastered his control of energy as once he had mastered lost though not forgotten limbs
he sank like a mist into the earthquakeproof vaults until he found himself among billions of stored memories and dazzling flickering networks of electronic thoughts
this task was more complex than the triggering of a crude nuclear bomb and took him a little longer
before he found the information he was seeking he made one trivial slip but did not bother to correct it
no one ever understood why the next month three hundred florida taxpayers all of whose names began with f received cheques for precisely one dollar
it cost many times the overpayment to straighten matters out and the baffled computer engineers finally put the blame on a cosmic ray shower
which on the whole was not so very far from the truth
in a few milliseconds he had moved from tallahassee to 634 south magnolia street tampa
it was still the same address he need not have wasted time looking it up
but then he had never intended to look it up until the very moment when he had done so
after three births and two abortions betty fernandez n e schultz was still a beautiful woman
at the moment she was also a very thoughtful one she was watching a tv programme that brought back memories bitter and sweet
it was a news special triggered by the mysterious events of the preceding twelve hours beginning with the warning that leonov had beamed back from the moons of jupiter
something was heading for earth something had harmlessly detonated an orbiting nuclear bomb which no one had come forward to claim
that was all but it was quite enough
the news commentators had dredged up all the old videotapes and some of them really were tapes going back to the once top secret records showing the discovery of tma l on the moon
for the fiftieth time at least she heard that eerie radio shriek as the monolith greeted the lunar dawn and hurled its message toward jupiter
and once again she watched the familiar scenes and listened to the old interviews aboard discovery
why was she watching
it was all stored somewhere in the home archives though she never played it back when jos was around
perhaps she was expecting some newsflash she did not like to admit even to herself how much power the past still held over her emotions
and there was dave as she had expected
it was an old bbc interview of which she knew almost every word
he was talking about hal trying to decide whether the computer was self conscious or not
how young he looked how different from those last blurred images from the doomed discovery
and how much like bobby as she remembered him
the image wavered as her eyes filled with tears
no something was wrong with the set or the channel
both sound and image were behaving erratically
dave s lips were moving but she could hear nothing
then his face seemed to dissolve to melt into blocks of colour
it reformed blurred again and then was steady once more
but there was still no sound
where had they got this picture
this was not dave as a man but as a boy as she had known him first
he was looking out of the screen almost as if he could see her across the gulf of years
he smiled his lips moved
hello betty he said
it was not hard to form the words and to impose them on the currents pulsing in the audio circuits
the real difficulty was to slow down his thoughts to the glacial tempo of the human brain
and then to have to wait an eternity for the answer
betty fernandez was tough she was also intelligent and though she had been a housewife for a dozen years she had not forgotten her training as an electronics serviceperson
this was just another of the medium s countless miracles of simulation she would accept it now and worry about the details later
dave she answered
dave is that really you i am not sure replied the image on the screen in a curiously toneless voice
but i remember dave bowman and everything about him is he dead now that was another difficult question
his body yes
but that is no longer important
all that dave bowman really was is still part of me betty crossed herself that was a gesture she had learned from jos and whispered you mean you re a spirit i do not know a better word why have you returned ah
betty why indeed
i wish you could tell me yet he knew one answer for it was appearing on the tv screen
the divorce between body and mind was still far from complete and not even the most complaisant of the cable networks would have transmitted the blatantly sexual images that were forming there now
betty watched for a little while sometimes smiling sometimes shocked
then she turned away not through shame but sadness regret for lost delights
so it s not true she said what they always told us about angels am i an angel
he wondered
but at least he understood what he was doing there swept back by the tides of sorrow and desire to a rendezvous with his past
the most powerful emotion he had ever known had been his passion for betty the elements of grief and guilt it contained only made it stronger
she had never told him if he was a better lover than bobby that was one question he had never asked for that would have broken the spell
they had clung to the same illusion sought in each other s arms and how young he had been still only seventeen when it had started barely two years after the funeral
a balm for the same wound
of course it could not last but the experience had left him irrevocably changed
for more than a decade all his autoerotic fantasies had centred upon betty he had never found another woman to compare with her and long ago had realized that he never would
no one else was haunted by the same beloved ghost
the images of desire faded from the screen for a moment the regular programme broke through with an incongruous shot of leonov hanging above io
then dave bowman s face reappeared
he seemed to be losing control for its lineaments were wildly unstable
sometimes he would seem only ten years old then twenty or thirty then incredibly a wizened mummy whose wrinkled features were a parody of the man she had once known
i have one more question before i go
carlos you always said he was jose s son and i always wondered
what was the truth betty fernandez stared for one long last time into the eyes of the boy she had once loved he was eighteen again and for a moment she wished she could see his entire body not merely his face
he was your son david she whispered
the image faded the normal service resumed
when almost an hour later jos fernandez came quietly into the room betty was still staring at the screen
she did not turn around as he kissed her on the back of the neck
you ll never believe this jos try me i ve just lied to a ghost 34 valediction when the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics published its controversial summary fifty years of ufos in 1997 many critics pointed out that unidentified flying objects had been observed for centuries and that kenneth arnold s flying saucer sighting of 1947 had countless precedents
people had been seeing strange things in the sky since the dawn of history but until the mid twentieth century ufos were a random phenomenon of no general interest
after that date they became a matter of public and scientific concern and the basis for what could only be called religious beliefs
the reason was not far to seek the arrival of the giant rocket and the dawn of the space age had turned men s minds to other worlds
realization that the human race would soon be able to leave the planet of its birth prompted the inevitable questions where s everyone and when may we expect visitors
there was also the hope though it was seldom spelled out in as many words that benevolent creatures from the stars might help mankind heal its numerous self inflicted wounds and save it from future disasters
any student of psychology could have predicted that so profound a need would be swiftly satisfied
during the last half of the twentieth century there were literally thousands of reports of spacecraft sightings from every part of the globe
more than that there were hundreds of reports of close encounters actual meetings with extraterrestrial visitors frequently embellished by tales of celestial joyrides abductions and even honeymoons in space
the fact that over and over again these were demonstrated to be lies or hallucinations did nothing to deter the faithful
men who had been shown cities on the far side of the moon lost little credibility even when orbiter surveys and apollo revealed no artifacts of any kind ladies who married venusians were still believed when that planet sadly turned out to be hotter than molten lead
by the time the alaa published its report no reputable scientist even among those few who had once espoused the idea believed that ufos had any connection with extraterrestrial life or intelligence
of course it would never be possible to prove that any one of those myriad sightings over the last thousand years might have been the real thing
but as time went by and satellite cameras and radars scanning the entire heavens produced no concrete evidence the general public lost interest in the idea
the cultists of course were not discouraged but kept the faith with their newsletters and books most of them regurgitating and embellishing old reports long after they had been discredited or exposed
when the discovery of the tycho monolith tma i was finally announced there was a chorus of i told you so s it could no longer be denied that there had been visitors to the moon and presumably to the earth as well a little matter of three million years ago
at once ufos infested the heavens again though it was odd that the three independent national tracking systems which could locate anything in space larger than a ballpoint pen were still unable to find them
rather quickly the number of reports dropped down to the noise level once more the figure that would be expected merely as a result of the many astronomical meteorological and aeronautical phenomena constantly occurring in the skies
but now it had started all over again
this time there was no mistake it was official
a genuine ufo was on its way to earth
sightings were reported within minutes of the warning from leonov the first close encounters were only a few hours later
a retired stockbroker walking his bulldog on the yorkshire moors was astonished when a disk shaped craft landed beside him and the occupant quite human except for the pointed ears asked the way to downing street
the contactee was so surprised that he was only able to wave his stick in the general direction of whitehall conclusive proof of the meeting was provided by the fact that the bulldog now refused to take his food
although the stockbroker had no previous history of mental illness even those who believed him had some difficulty in accepting the next report
this time it was a basque shepherd on a traditional mission he was greatly relieved when what he had feared to be border guards turned out to be a couple of cloaked men with piercing eyes who wanted to know the way to the united nations headquarters
they spoke perfect basque an excruciatingly difficult tongue with no affinity to any other known language of mankind
clearly the space visitors were remarkable linguists even if their geography was oddly deficient
so it went on case after case
very few of the contactees were actually lying or insane most of them sincerely believed their own stories and retained that belief even under hypnosis
and some were just victims of practical jokes or improbable accidents like the unlucky amateur archaeologists who found the props that a celebrated science fiction moviemaker had abandoned in the tunisian desert almost four decades earlier
yet only at the beginning and at the very end was any human being genuinely aware of his presence and that was because he so desired it
the world was his to explore and examine as he pleased without restraint or hindrance
no walls could keep him out no secrets could be hidden from the senses he possessed
at first he believed that he was merely fulfilling old ambitions by visiting the places he had never seen in that earlier existence
not until much later did he realize that his lightning like sallies across the face of the globe had a deeper purpose
in some subtle way he was being used as a probe sampling every aspect of human affairs
the control was so tenuous that he was barely conscious of it he was rather like a hunting dog on a leash allowed to make excursions of his own yet nevertheless compelled to obey the overriding wishes of his master
the pyramids the grand canyon the moon washed snows of everest these were choices of his own
so were some art galleries and concert halls though he would certainly on his own initiative never have endured the whole of the ring
nor would he have visited so many factories prisons hospitals a nasty little war in asia a racecourse a complicated orgy in beverly hills the oval room of the white house the kremlin archives the vatican library the sacred black stone of the kaabah at mecca
there were also experiences of which he had no clear memory as if they had been censored or he was being protected from them by some guardian angel
for example what was he doing at the leakey memorial museum in olduvai gorge
he had no greater interest in the origin of man than any other intelligent member of the species h sapiens and fossils meant nothing to him
yet the famous skulls guarded like crown jewels in their display cases aroused strange echoes in his memory and an excitement for which he was unable to account
there was a feeling of d ja vu stronger than any he had ever known the place should be familiar but something was wrong
it was like a house to which one returns after many years to find that all the furniture has been changed the walls moved and even the stairways rebuilt
it was bleak hostile terrain dry and parched
where were the lush plains and the myriad fleet footed herbivores that had roamed across them three million years ago
three million years
how had he known that
no answer came from the echoing silence into which he had thrown the question
but then he saw once more looming before him a familiar black rectangular shape
he approached and a shadowy image appeared in its depths like a reflection in a pool of ink
the sad and puzzled eyes that stared back from beneath that hairy receding forehead looked beyond him into a future they could never see
for he was that future a hundred thousand generations further down the stream of time
history had begun there that at least he now understood
but how and above all why were secrets still withheld from him
but there was one last duty and that was hardest of all
he was still sufficiently human to put it off until the very end
now what s she up to
the duty nurse asked herself zooming the tv monitor onto the old lady
she s tried lots of tricks but this is the first time i ve seen her talking to her hearing aid for goodness sake
i wonder what she s saying
the microphone was not sensitive enough to pick up the words but that scarcely seemed to matter
jessie bowman had seldom looked so peaceful and content
though her eyes were closed her entire face was wreathed in an almost angelic smile while her lips continued to form whispered words
and then the watcher saw something that she tried hard to forget because to report it would instantly disqualify her in the nursing profession
slowly and jerkily the comb lying on the bedside table raised itself in the air as if lifted by clumsy invisible fingers
on the first attempt it missed then with obvious difficulty it began to part the long silver strands pausing sometimes to disentangle a knot
jessie bowman was not speaking now but she continued to smile
the comb was moving with more assurance and no longer in abrupt uncertain jerks
how long it lasted the nurse could never be certain
not until the comb was gently replaced on the table did she recover from her paralysis
ten year old dave bowman had finished the chore which he always hated but which his mother loved
and a david bowman who was now ageless had gained his first control of obdurate matter
jessie bowman was still smiling when the nurse finally came to investigate
she had been too scared to hurry but it would have made no difference anyway
35 rehabilitation the uproar of earth was comfortably muted across the millions of kilometres of space
leonov s crew watched with fascination yet with a certain detachment the debates in the united nations the interviews with distinguished scientists the theorizing of the news commentators the matter of fact yet wildly conflicting accounts of the ufo contactees
they could contribute nothing to the brouhaha for they had witnessed no further manifestations of any kind
zagadka alias big brother remained as blankly indifferent to their presence as ever
and that was indeed an ironic situation they had come all the way from earth to solve a mystery and it looked as if the answer might be right back at their starting point
for the first time they felt grateful for the slow velocity of light and the two hour delay that made live interviews impossible on the earth jupiter circuit
even so floyd was badgered by so many media requests that he finally went on strike
nothing more remained to be said and he had said it at least a dozen times
besides there was still much work to be done
leonov had to be prepared for the long journey home so that it would be ready to depart immediately when the launch window opened
the timing was not at all critical even if they missed by a month that would merely prolong the trip
chandra curnow and floyd would not even notice as they slept their way toward the sun but the rest of the crew was grimly determined to leave just as soon as the laws of celestial mechanics permitted
discovery still posed many problems
the ship had barely sufficient propellant for the return to earth even if it left much later than leonov and flew a minimum energy orbit which would take almost three years
and this would be possible only if hal could be reliably programmed to carry out the mission with no human intervention except long range monitoring
without his cooperation discovery would have to be abandoned once again
it had been fascinating indeed deeply moving to watch the steady regrowth of hal s personality from brain damaged child to puzzled adolescent and at length to slightly condescending adult
although he knew that such anthropomorphic labels were highly misleading floyd found it quite impossible to avoid them
and there were times when he felt that the whole situation had a haunting familiarity
how often he had seen videodramas in which disturbed youngsters were straightened out by all wise descendants of the legendary sigmund freud
essentially the same story was being played out in the shadow of jupiter
the electronic psychoanalysis had proceeded at a speed totally beyond human comprehension as repair and diagnostic programs flashed through hal s circuits at billions of bits a second pinpointing possible malfunctions and correcting them
though most of these programs had been tested in advance on hal s twin sal 9 the impossibility of a real time dialogue between the two computers was a serious handicap
sometimes hours were wasted when it proved necessary to check back with earth at a critical point in the therapy
for despite all chandra s work the computer s rehabilitation was still far from complete
hal exhibited numerous idiosyncrasies and nervous tics sometimes even ignoring spoken words though he would always acknowledge keyboard inputs from anyone
in the reverse direction his outputs were even more eccentric
there were times when he would give verbal replies but would not display them visually
at other times he would do both but refused to print hard copy
he would give no excuses or explanations not even the stubbornly impenetrable i prefer not to of melville s autistic scrivener bartelby
however he was not actively disobedient so much as reluctant and only where certain tasks were concerned
it was always possible to win his cooperation eventually to talk him out of his sulk as curnow put it neatly
it was not surprising that dr chandra was beginning to show the strain
on one celebrated occasion when max brailovsky innocently revived an old canard he almost lost his temper
is it true dr chandra that you chose the name hal to be one step ahead of ibm utter nonsense
half of us come from ibm and we ve been trying to stamp out that story for years
i thought that by now every intelligent person knew that h a l is derived from heuristic algorithmic afterward max swore that he could distinctly hear the capital letters
in floyd s private opinion the odds were at least fifty to one against flying discovery safely back to earth
and then chandra came to him with an extraordinary proposal
dr floyd can i have a word with you after all the weeks and shared experiences chandra was still as formal as ever not only to floyd but to all the crew
he would not even address the ship s baby zenia without the prefix ma am
of course chandra
what is it i ve virtually completed the programming for the six most probable variations on the hohmann return orbit
five have now been run on a simulation without any problems excellent
i m sure that no one else on earth in the solar system could have done it thank you
however you know as well as i do that it s impossible to program for every eventuality
hal may will function perfectly and will be able to handle any reasonable emergency
but all sorts of trivial accidents minor equipment failures that could be fixed with a screwdriver broken wires stuck switches could leave him helpless and abort the whole mission you re absolutely right of course and it s been worrying me
but what can we do about it it s really quite simple
i d like to stay with discovery floyd s immediate reaction was that chandra had gone crazy
on second thoughts perhaps he was only half crazy
it might indeed make all the difference between success and failure to have a human being that superb all purpose trouble shooting and repair device aboard discovery for the long voyage back to earth
but the objections were completely overwhelming
it s an interesting idea floyd answered with extreme caution and i certainly appreciate your enthusiasm
but have you thought of all the problems that was a silly thing to say chandra would have all the answers already filed away for immediate retrieval
you ll be on your own for over three years
suppose you had an accident or a medical emergency that s a risk i m prepared to take and what about food water
leonov doesn t have enough to spare i ve checked discovery s recycling system it can be made operational again without too much difficulty
besides we indians can manage on very little it was unusual for chandra to refer to his origins or indeed to make any personal statements his true confession was the only example floyd could remember
but he did not doubt the claim curnow had once remarked that dr chandra had the sort of physique that could only be achieved by centuries of starvation
although it sounded like one of the engineer s unkinder wisecracks it had been made entirely without malice indeed with sympathy though not of course in chandra s hearing
well we still have several weeks to decide
i ll think it over and talk to washington thank you do you mind if i start making the arrangements er not at all as long as they don t interfere with the existing plans
remember mission control will have to make the final decision and i know exactly what mission control will say
it was madness to expect a man to survive in space for three years alone
but of course chandra had always been alone
36 fire in the deep earth was already far behind and the awesome wonders of the jovian system were expanding swiftly before him when he had his revelation
how could he have been so blind so stupid
it was as if he had been walking in his sleep now he was starting to awaken
who are you
he cried
what do you want
why have you done this to me
there was no answer yet he was certain that he had been heard
he sensed a presence even as a man can tell though his eyes are tightly shut that he is in a closed room and not some empty open space
around him there was the faint echo of a vast mentality an implacable will
he called again into the reverberant silence and again there was no direct reply only that sense of watchful companionship
very well he would find the answers for himself
some were obvious whoever or whatever they were they were interested in mankind
they had tapped and stored his memories for their own inscrutable purposes
and now they had done the same with his deepest emotions sometimes with his cooperation sometimes without
he did not resent that indeed the very processing he had experienced made such childish reactions impossible
he was beyond love and hate and desire and fear but he had not forgotten them and could still understand how they ruled the world of which he had once been part
was that the purpose of the exercise
if so for what ultimate goal
he had become a player in a game of gods and must learn the rules as he went along
the jagged rocks of the four tiny outer moons sinope pasiphae carme and ananke flickered briefly across his field of consciousness then came elara lysithea himalia and leda at half their distance from jupiter
he ignored them all now the pock marked face of callisto lay ahead
once twice he orbited the battered globe larger than earth s own moon while senses of which he had been unaware probed its outer layers of ice and dust
his curiosity was quickly satisfied the world was a frozen fossil still bearing the marks of collisions that aeons ago must have come close to shattering it
one hemisphere was a giant bull s eye a series of concentric rings where solid rock had once flowed in kilometre high ripples under some ancient hammer blow from space
seconds later he was circling ganymede
now there was a far more complex and interesting world though so near to callisto and almost the same size it presented an utterly different appearance
there were it was true numerous craters but most of them seemed to have been quite literally ploughed back into the ground
the most extraordinary feature of the ganymedean landscape was the presence of meandering stripes built up from scores of parallel furrows a few kilometres apart
this grooved terrain looked as if it had been produced by armies of intoxicated ploughmen weaving back and forth across the face of the satellite
in a few revolutions he saw more of ganymede than all the space probes ever sent from earth and filed away the knowledge for future use
one day it would be important he was sure of that though he did not know why any more than he understood the impulse that was now driving him so purposefully from world to world
as presently it brought him to europa
though he was still largely a passive spectator he was aware now of a rising interest a focusing of attention a concentration of will
even if he was a puppet in the hands of an unseen and uncommunicative master some of the thoughts of that controlling influence leaked or were allowed to leak into his own mind
the smooth intricately patterned globe now rushing toward him bore little resemblance either to ganymede or callisto
it looked organic the network of lines branching and intersecting over its entire surface was uncannily like a world spanning system of veins and arteries
the endless ice fields of a frigid waste far colder than the antarctic stretched beneath him
then with brief surprise he saw that he was passing over the wreckage of a spaceship
he recognized it instantly as the ill fated tsien featured in so many of the video newscasts he had analysed
not now not now there would be ample opportunity later
then he was through the ice and into a world as unknown to his controllers as to himself
it was an ocean world its hidden waters protected from the vacuum of space by a crust of ice
in most places the ice was kilometres thick but there were lines of weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart
then there had been a brief battle between two implacably hostile elements that came into direct contact on no other world in the solar system
the war between sea and space always ended in the same stalemate the exposed water simultaneously boiled and froze repairing the armour of ice
the seas of europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without the influence of nearby jupiter
its gravity continually kneaded the core of the little world the forces that convulsed io were working there though with much less ferocity
as he skimmed across the face of the deep he saw everywhere the evidence of that tug of war between planet and satellite
and he both heard and felt it in the continual roar and thunder of submarine earthquakes the hiss of escaping gases from the interior the infrasonic pressure waves of avalanches sweeping over the abyssal plains
by comparison with the tumultuous ocean that covered europa even the noisy seas of earth were silent
he had not lost his sense of wonder and the first oasis filled him with delighted surprise
it extended for almost a kilometre around a tangled mass of pipes and chimneys deposited by mineral brines gushing from the interior
out of that natural parody of a gothic castle black scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm as if driven by the beating of some mighty heart
and like blood they were the authentic sign of life itself
the boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above and formed an island of warmth on the seabed
equally important they brought from europa s interior all the chemicals of life
there in an environment where none had expected it were energy and food in abundance
yet it should have been expected he remembered that only a lifetime ago such fertile oases had been discovered in the deep oceans of earth
here they were present on an immensely larger scale and in far greater variety
in the tropical zone close to the contorted walls of the castle were delicate spidery structures that seemed to be the analogy of plants though almost all were capable of movement
crawling among these were bizarre slugs and worms some feeding on the plants others obtaining their food directly from the mineral laden waters around them
at greater distances from the source of heat the submarine fire around which all the creatures warmed themselves were sturdier more robust organisms not unlike crabs or spiders
armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying that one small oasis
unlike the palaeozoic terrestrial seas it was not a stable environment so evolution had progressed swiftly here producing multitudes of fantastic forms
and they were all under indefinite stay of execution sooner or later each fountain of life would weaken and die as the forces that powered it moved their focus elsewhere
again and again in his wanderings across the europan seabed he encountered the evidence of such tragedies
countless circular areas were littered with the skeletons and mineral encrusted remains of dead creatures where entire chapters of evolution had been deleted from the book of life
he saw huge empty shells formed like convoluted trumpets as large as a man
there were clams of many shapes bivalves and even trivalves
and there were spiral stone patterns many metres across which seemed an exact analogy of the beautiful ammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from earth s oceans at the end of the cretaceous period
searching seeking he moved back and forth over the face of the abyss
perhaps the greatest of all the wonders he met was a river of incandescent lava flowing for a hundred kilometres along a sunken valley
the pressure at that depth was so great that the water in contact with the red hot magma could not flash into steam and the two liquids coexisted in an uneasy truce
there on another world and with alien actors something like the story of egypt had been played long before the coming of man
as the nile had brought life to a narrow ribbon of desert so this river of warmth had vivified the europan deep
along its banks in a band never more than two kilometres wide species after species had evolved and flourished and passed away
and at least one had left a monument behind it
at first he thought that it was merely another of the encrustations of mineral salts that surrounded almost all the thermal vents
however as he came closer he saw that it was not a natural formation but a structure created by intelligence
or perhaps by instinct on earth the termites reared castles that were almost equally imposing and the web of a spider was more exquisitely designed
the creatures that had lived there must have been quite small for the single entrance was only half a metre wide
that entrance a thick walled tunnel made by heaping rocks on top of each other gave a clue to the builders intentions
they had reared a fortress there in the flickering glow not far from the banks of their molten nile
and then they had vanished
they could not have left more than a few centuries before
the walls of the fortress built from irregularly shaped rocks that must have been collected with great labour were covered with only a thin crust of mineral deposits
one piece of evidence suggested why the stronghold had been abandoned
part of the roof had fallen in perhaps owing to the continual earthquakes and in an underwater environment a fort without a roof was wide open to an enemy
he encountered no other sign of intelligence along the river of lava
once however he saw something uncannily like a crawling man except that it had no eyes and no nostrils only a huge toothless mouth that gulped continuously absorbing nourishment from the liquid medium around it
along the narrow band of fertility in the deserts of the deep whole cultures and even civilizations might have risen and fallen armies might have marched or swum under the command of europan tamberlanes or napoleons
and the rest of their world would never have known for all those oases of warmth were as isolated from one another as the planets themselves
the creatures who basked in the glow of the lava river and fed around the hot vents could not cross the hostile wilderness between their lonely islands if they had ever produced historians and philosophers each culture would have been convinced that it was alone in the universe
yet even the space between the oases was not altogether empty of life there were hardier creatures who had dared its rigours
often swimming overhead were the europan analogues of fish streamlined torpedoes propelled by vertical tails steered by fins along their bodies
the resemblance to the most successful dwellers in earth s oceans was inevitable given the same engineering problems evolution must produce very similar answers
as witness the dolphin and the shark superficially almost identical yet from far distant branches of the tree of life
there was however one very obvious difference between the fish of the europan seas and those in terrestrial oceans they had no gills for there was hardly a trace of oxygen to be extracted from the waters in which they swam
like the creatures around earth s own geothermal vents their metabolism was based on sulphur compounds present in abundance in the near volcanic environment
and very few had eyes
apart from the flickering glow of the rare lava outpourings and occasional bursts of bioluminescence from creatures seeking mates or hunters questing prey it was a lightless world
it was also a doomed one
not only were its energy sources sporadic and constantly shifting but the tidal forces that drove them were steadily weakening
even if they developed true intelligence the europans must perish with the final freezing of their world
they were trapped between fire and ice
37 estrangement i m truly sorry old friend to be the bearer of such bad news but caroline has asked me and you know how i feel about you both
and i don t think it can be such a surprise
some of the remarks you ve made to me over the last year have hinted at it and you know how bitter she was when you left earth
no i don t believe there s anyone else
if there was she d have told me
but sooner or later well she s an attractive young woman
chris is fine and of course he doesn t know what s happening
at least he won t be hurt
he s too young to understand and children are incredibly elastic
just a minute i ll have to key my thesaurus ah resilient
now to things that may seem less important to you
everyone is still trying to explain that bomb detonation as an accident but of course nobody believes it
because nothing else has happened the general hysteria has died down we re left with what one of your commentators has called the looking over the shoulder syndrome
and someone has found a hundred year old poem that sums up the situation so neatly that everybody s quoting it
it s set in the last days of the roman empire at the gates of a city whose occupants are waiting for invaders to arrive
the emperor and dignitaries are all lined up in their most costly togas ready with speeches of welcome
the senate has closed because any laws it passes today will be ignored by the new masters
then suddenly a dreadful piece of news arrives from the frontier
there aren t any invaders
the reception committee breaks up in confusion everyone goes home muttering disappointedly now what will happen to us
those people were a kind of solution
there s just one slight change needed to bring the poem up to date
it s called waiting for the barbarians and this time we are the barbarians
and we don t know what we re waiting for but it certainly hasn t arrived
one other item
had you heard that commander bowman s mother died only a few days after the thing came to earth
it does seem an odd coincidence but the people at her nursing home say that she never showed the slightest interest in the news so it couldn t possibly have affected her floyd switched off the recording
dimitri was right he was not taken by surprise
but that made not the slightest difference it hurt just as badly
yet what else could he have done
if he had refused to go on the mission as caroline had so clearly hoped he would have felt guilty and unfulfilled for the remainder of his life
that would have poisoned his marriage better this clean break when physical distance softened the pain of separation
or did it
in some ways it made things worse
more important was duty and the sense of being part of a team devoted to a single goal
so jessie bowman was gone
perhaps that was another cause for guilt
he had helped to steal her only remaining son and that must have contributed to her mental breakdown
inevitably he was reminded of a discussion that walter curnow had started on that very subject
why did you choose dave bowman
he always struck me as a cold fish not actually unfriendly but whenever he came into the room the temperature seemed to drop ten degrees that was one of the reasons we did select him
he had no close family ties except for a mother he didn t see very often
so he was the sort of man we could send on a long open ended mission how did he get that way i suppose the psychologists could tell you
i did see his report of course but that was a long time ago
there was something about a brother who was killed and his father died soon afterward in an accident on one of the early shuttles
i m not supposed to tell you this but it certainly doesn t matter now it didn t matter but it was interesting
now floyd almost envied david bowman who had come to that very spot a free man unencumbered by emotional ties with earth
no he was deceiving himself
even while the pain gripped his heart like a vice what he felt for david bowman was not envy but pity
38 foamscape the last beast he saw before he left the oceans of europa was much the largest
it closely resembled one of the banyan trees from earth s tropics whose scores of trunks allow a single plant to create a small forest sometimes covering hundreds of square metres
the specimen however was walking apparently on a trek between oases
if it was not one of the creatures that had destroyed tsien it certainly belonged to a very similar species
now he had learned all that he needed to know or rather all that they needed to know
there was one more moon to visit seconds later the burning landscape of io lay below him
it was as he had expected
energy and food were there in abundance but the time was not yet ripe for their union
around some of the cooler sulphur lakes the first steps had been taken on the road to life but before any degree of organization had occurred all such bravely premature attempts were thrown back into the melting pot
not until the tidal forces that drove io s furnaces had lost their power millions of years later would there be anything to interest biologists on that seared and sterilized world
he wasted little time on io and none at all on the tiny inner moons that skirted jupiter s ghostly rings themselves only pale shadows of the glory that was saturn s
the greatest of worlds lay before him he would know it as no man had ever done or ever would
the million kilometre long tendrils of magnetic force the sudden explosions of radio waves the geysers of electrified plasma wider than the planet earth they were as real and clearly visible to him as the clouds banding the planet in multihued glory
he could understand the complex pattern of their interactions and realized that jupiter was much more wonderful than anyone had ever guessed
even as he fell through the roaring heart of the great red spot with the lightning of its continent wide thunderstorms detonating around him he knew why it had persisted for centuries though it was made of gases far less substantial than those that formed the hurricanes of earth
the thin scream of hydrogen wind faded as he sank into the calmer depths and a sleet of waxen snowflakes some already coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam descended from the heights above
it was already warm enough for liquid water to exist but there were no oceans there that purely gaseous environment was too tenuous to support them
he descended through layer after layer of cloud until he entered a region of such clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than a thousand kilometres across
it was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of the great red spot and it held a secret that men had long guessed but never proved
skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriads of small sharply defined clouds all about the same size and patterned with similar red and brown mottlings
they were small only as compared with the inhuman scale of their surroundings the very least would have covered a fair sized city
they were clearly alive for they were moving with slow deliberation along the flanks of the aerial mountains browsing off their slopes like colossal sheep
and they were calling to each other in the metre band their radio voices faint but clear against the cracklings and concussions of jupiter itself
nothing less than living gasbags they floated in the narrow zone between freezing heights and scorching depths
narrow yes but a domain far larger than all the biosphere of earth
they were not alone
moving swiftly among them were other creatures so small that they could easily have been overlooked
some of them bore an almost uncanny resemblance to terrestrial aircraft and were of about the same size
but they too were alive perhaps predators perhaps parasites perhaps even herdsmen
a whole new chapter of evolution as alien as that which he had glimpsed on europa was opening before him
there were jet propelled torpedoes like the squids of the terrestrial oceans hunting and devouring the huge gasbags
but the balloons were not defenceless some of them fought backs with electric thunderbolts and with clawed tentacles like kilometre long chainsaws
there were even stranger shapes exploiting almost every possibility of geometry bizarre translucent kites tetrahedra spheres polyhedra tangles of twisted ribbons
the gigantic plankton of the jovian atmosphere they were designed to float like gossamer in the uprising currents until they had lived long enough to reproduce then they would be swept down into the depths to be carbonized and recycled in a new generation
he was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of earth and though he saw many wonders nothing there hinted of intelligence
the radio voices of the great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or of fear
even the hunters who might have been expected to develop higher degrees of organization were like the sharks in earth s oceans mindless automata
and for all its breathtaking size and novelty the biosphere of jupiter was a fragile world a place of mists and foam of delicate silken threads and paper thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed by lightning in the upper atmosphere
few of its constructs were more substantial than soap bubbles its most terrifying predators could be torn to shreds by even the feeblest of terrestrial carnivores
like europa on a vastly grander scale jupiter was an evolutionary cul de sac
consciousness would never emerge here even if it did it would be doomed to a stunted existence
a purely aerial culture might develop but in an environment where fire was impossible and solids scarcely existed it could never even reach the stone age
and now as he hovered above the centre of a jovian cyclone merely as large as africa he became aware once again of the presence controlling him
moods and emotions were leaking into his own consciousness though he could not identify any specific concepts or ideas
it was as if he were listening outside a closed door to a debate in progress and in a language he could not understand
but the muffled sounds clearly conveyed disappointment then uncertainty then a sudden determination though for what purpose he could not tell
once again he felt like a pet dog able to share his master s changing moods but not to comprehend them
and then the invisible leash was taking him down toward the heart of jupiter
he was sinking through the clouds below the level where any form of life was possible
soon he was beyond the reach of the last rays from the faint and distant sun
the pressure and temperature were swiftly mounting already it was above the boiling point of water and he passed briefly through a layer of superheated steam
jupiter was like an onion he was peeling it away skin by skin though as yet he had travelled only a fraction of the distance to its core
beneath the steam was a witches brew of petrochemicals enough to power for a million years all the internal combustion engines that mankind had dyer built
it became thicker and denser then quite abruptly it ended at a discontinuity only a few kilometres thick
heavier than any rocks on earth yet still a liquid the next shell consisted of silicon and carbon compounds of a complexity that could have provided lifetimes of work for terrestrial chemists
layer followed layer for thousands of kilometres but as the temperature rose into the hundreds and then the thousands of degrees the composition of the various strata became simpler and simpler
halfway down to the core it was too hot for chemistry all compounds were torn apart and only the basic elements could exist
next there came a deep sea of hydrogen but not hydrogen as it had ever existed for more than a fraction of a second in any laboratory on earth
this hydrogen was under such enormous pressure that it had become a metal
he had almost reached the centre of the planet but jupiter had one more surprise in store
the thick shell of metallic yet still fluid hydrogen ended abruptly
at last there was a solid surface sixty thousand kilometres down
for ages the carbon baked out of the chemical reactions far above had been drifting down toward the centre of the planet
there it had gathered crystallizing at a pressure of millions of atmospheres
and there by one of nature s supreme jests was something very precious to mankind
the core of jupiter forever beyond human reach was a diamond as big as the earth
39 in the pod bay walter i m worried about heywood i know tanya but what can we do curnow had never seen commander orlova in so indecisive a mood it made her seem much more appealing despite his prejudice against small women
i m very fond of him but that s not the reason
his i suppose gloom is the best word for it is making everyone miserable
leonov has been a happy ship
i want to keep it that way why don t you talk to him
he respects you and i m sure he ll do his best to snap out of it i intend to do just that
and if it doesn t work well there s one simple solution
what more can he do on this trip
when we start back for home he ll be in hibernation anyway
we could always what do you say jump the gun on him phew the same dirty trick that katerina played on me
he d be mad when he woke up but also safely back on earth and very busy
i m sure he d forgive us i don t think you re serious
even if i backed you up washington would raise hell
besides suppose something happened and we really need him badly
isn t there a two week buffer period before you can revive anyone safely at heywood s age more like a month
yes we d be committed
but what do you think could happen now
he s done the job he was sent for apart from keeping an eye on us
and i m sure you ve been well briefed about that in some obscure suburb of virginia or maryland i neither confirm nor deny
and frankly i m a lousy undercover agent
i talk too much and i hate security
i ve fought all my life to keep my rating below restricted
every time there was danger of being reclassified confidential or worse still secret i d go and create a scandal
though that s getting very difficult nowadays walter you re incorrupt incorrigible yes that s the word i meant
but back to heywood please
would you like to talk to him first you mean give him a pep talk
i d rather help katerina drive in the needle
our psychologies are too different
he thinks i m a loudmouthed clown which you often are
but that s only to hide your real feelings
some of us have evolved the theory that deep down inside you is a really nice person struggling to get out for once curnow was at a loss for words
finally he mumbled oh very well i ll do my best
but don t expect miracles my profile gave me z for tact
where s he hiding at the moment in the pod bay
he claims he s working on his final report but i don t believe it
he just wants to get away from us all and that s the quietest place that was not the reason though it was indeed an important one
unlike the carousel where most of the action aboard discovery was then taking place the pod bay was a zero gee environment
right at the beginning of the space age men had discovered the euphoria of weightlessness and remembered the freedom they had lost when they left the ancient womb of the sea
beyond gravity some of that freedom was regained with the loss of weight went many of the cares and worries of earth
heywood floyd had not forgotten his sorrow but it was more bearable there
when he was able to look at the matter dispassionately he was surprised at the strength of his reaction to an event not wholly unexpected
more than loss of love was involved though that was the worst part
the blow had come when he was particularly vulnerable at the very moment when he was feeling a sense of anticlimax even futility
and he knew precisely why
he had achieved all that he had been expected to do thanks to the skill and cooperation of his colleagues he was letting them down he knew by his present selfishness
if all went well that litany of the space age
they would return to earth with a cargo of knowledge that no expedition had ever gathered before and a few years later even the once lost discovery would be restored to her builders
it was not enough
the overpowering enigma of big brother remained out there only a few kilometres away mocking all human aspirations and achievements
just as its analogue on the moon had done a decade ago it had come to life for a moment then relapsed into stubborn inertness
it was a closed door upon which they had hammered in vain
only david bowman it seemed had ever found the key
perhaps that explained the attraction he felt for the quiet and sometimes even mysterious place
from there from that now empty launch cradle bowman had left on his last mission through the circular hatchway that led to infinity
he found the thought exhilarating rather than depressing certainly it helped to distract him from his personal problems
nina s vanished twin was part of the history of space exploration it had travelled in the words of the hoary old clich that always evoked a smile yet an acknowledgement of its fundamental truth where no man had gone before where was it now
would he ever know
he would sometimes sit for hours in the crowded but not cramped little capsule trying to collect his thoughts and occasionally dictating notes the other crew members respected his privacy and understood the reason for it
they never came near the pod bay and had no need to do so
its refurbishment was a job for the future and some other team
once or twice when he had felt really depressed he found himself thinking suppose i ordered hal to open the pod bay doors and set out along dave bowman s trail
would i be greeted by the miracle he saw and which vasili glimpsed a few weeks ago
it would solve all my problems
even if the thought of chris did not deter him there was an excellent reason why so suicidal a move was out of the question
nina was a very complex piece of equipment he could no more operate her than fly a fighter aircraft
he was not meant to be an intrepid explorer that particular fantasy would remain unrealized
walter curnow had seldom undertaken a mission with more reluctance
he felt genuinely sorry for floyd but at the same time a little impatient with the other s distress
his own emotional life was broad but shallow he had never put all his eggs in one basket
more than once he had been told that he spread himself too thin and though he had never regretted it he was beginning to think it was time to settle down
he took the shortcut through the carousel control centre noting that the maximum speed reset indicator was still flashing idiotically
a major part of his job was deciding when warnings could be ignored when they could be dealt with at leisure and when they had to be treated as real emergencies
if he paid equal attention to all the ship s cries for help he would never get anything done
he drifted along the narrow corridor that led to the pod bay propelling himself by occasional flicks against the rungs on the tubular wall
the pressure gauge claimed that there was vacuum on the other side of the airlock door but he knew better
it was a fail safe situation he could not have opened the lock if the gauge were telling the truth
the bay looked empty now that two of the three pods had long since gone
only a few emergency lights were operating and on the far wall one of hal s fish eye lenses was regarding him steadily
curnow waved to it but did not speak
at chandra s orders all audio inputs were still disconnected except for the one that only he used
floyd was sitting in the pod with his back to the open hatch dictating some notes and he swung slowly around at curnow s deliberately noisy approach
for a moment the two men regarded each other in silence then curnow announced portentously dr h floyd i bear greetings from our beloved captain
she considers it high time you rejoined the civilized world floyd gave a wan smile then a little laugh
please return my compliments
i m sorry i ve been unsociable
i ll see you all at the next six o clock soviet curnow relaxed his approach had worked
privately he considered floyd something of a stuffed shirt and had the practical engineer s tolerant contempt for theoretical scientists and bureaucrats
since floyd ranked high in both categories he was an almost irresistible target for curnow s sometimes peculiar sense of humour
nevertheless the two men had grown to respect and even admire each other
thankfully changing the subject curnow rapped on nina s brand new hatch cover straight from the spares store and contrasting vividly with the rest of the space pod s shabby exterior
i wonder when we ll send her out again he said
and who s going to ride in her this time
any decisions no
washington s got cold feet
moscow says let s take a chance
and tanya wants to wait what do you think i agree with tanya
we shouldn t interfere with zagadka until we re ready to leave
if anything goes wrong then that should improve the odds slightly curnow looked thoughtful and unusually hesitant what is it asked floyd sensing his change of mood
don t ever give me away but max was thinking of a little one man expedition i can t believe he was serious
he wouldn t dare tanya would have him clapped in irons that s what i told him more or less i m disappointed i thought he was a little more mature
after all he is thirty two thirty one
anyway i talked him out of it
i reminded him that this was real life not some stupid videodrama where the hero sneaks out into space without telling his companions and makes the big discovery now it was floyd s turn to feel a little uncomfortable
after all he had been thinking on similar lines
are you sure he won t try anything two hundred per cent sure
remember your precautions with hal
i ve already taken steps with nina
nobody flies her without my permission i still can t believe it
are you sure max wasn t pulling your leg his sense of humour isn t that subtle
besides be was pretty miserable at the time oh now i understand
it must have been when he had that row with zenia
i suppose he wanted to impress her
anyway they seem to have got over it i m afraid so curnow answered wryly
floyd could not help smiling curnow noticed it and started to chuckle which made floyd laugh which
it was a splendid example of positive feedback in a high gain loop
within seconds they were both laughing uncontrollably
the crisis was over
what was more they had taken the first step toward genuine friendship
they had exchanged vulnerabilities
4 daisy daisy the sphere of consciousness in which he was embedded enclosed the whole of jupiter s diamond core
he was dimly aware at the limits of his new comprehension that every aspect of the environment around him was being probed and analysed
immense quantities of data were being gathered not merely for storage and contemplation but for action
complex plans were being considered and evaluated decisions were being made that might affect the destiny of worlds
he was not yet part of the process but he would be
now you are beginning to understand
it was the first direct message
though it was remote and distant like a voice through a cloud it was unmistakably intended for him
before he could ask any of the myriad questions that raced through his mind there was a sense of withdrawal and once more he was alone
but only for a moment
closer and clearer came another thought and for the first time he realized that more than one entity was controlling and manipulating him
he was involved in a hierarchy of intelligences some close enough to his own primitive level to act as interpreters
or perhaps they were all aspects of a single being
or perhaps the distinction was totally meaningless
of one thing however he was now sure
he was being used as a tool and a good tool had to be sharpened modified adapted
and the very best tools were those that understood what they were doing
he was learning that now
it was a vast and awesome concept and he was privileged to be a part of it even though he was aware of only the merest outlines
he had no choice but to obey yet that did not mean that he must acquiesce to every detail at least without a protest
he had not yet lost all his human feeling that would have made him valueless
the soul of david bowman had passed beyond love but it could still know compassion for those who had once been his colleagues
very well came the answer to his plea
he could not tell whether the thought conveyed an amused condescension or total indifference
but there was no doubt of its majestic authority as it continued they must never know that they are being manipulated
that would ruin the purpose of the experiment
then there was a silence that he did not wish to breach again
he was still awed and shaken as if for a moment he had heard the clear voice of god
now he was moving purely under his own volition toward a destination he had chosen himself
the crystal heart of jupiter fell below the layers upon layers of helium and hydrogen and carbonaceous compounds flickered past
he had a glimpse of a great battle between something like a jellyfish fifty kilometres across and a swarm of spinning disks that moved more swiftly than anything he had yet seen in the jovian skies
the jellyfish appeared to be defending itself with chemical weapons from time to time it would emit jets of coloured gas and the disks touched by the vapour would start to wobble drunkenly then slip downward like falling leaves until they had disappeared from sight
he did not stop to watch the outcome he knew that it did not matter who were the victors and who the vanquished
as a salmon leaps a waterfall he flashed in seconds from jupiter to io against the descending electric currents of the flux tube
it was quiescent that day only the power of a few terrestrial thunderstorms was flowing between planet and satellite
the gateway through which he had returned still floated in that current shouldering it aside as it had done since the dawn of man
and there utterly dwarfed by the monument of a greater technology was the vessel that had brought him from the little world of his birth
how simple how crude
it now appeared
with a single scan he could see innumerable flaws and absurdities in its design as well as that of the slightly less primitive ship to which it was now coupled by a flexible airtight tube
it was hard to focus upon the handful of entities inhabiting the two ships he could barely interact with the soft creatures of flesh and blood who drifted like ghosts through the metal corridors and cabins
for their part they were totally unaware of his presence and he knew better than to reveal himself too abruptly
but there was someone with whom he could communicate in a mutual language of electric field and currents millions of times more swiftly than with sluggish organic brains
even if he had been capable of resentment he would have felt none toward hal he understood then that the computer had only chosen what seemed to be the most logical course of behaviour
it was time to resume a conversation that had been interrupted it seemed only moments ago
open the pod bay door hal i m sorry dave i can t do that what s the problem hal i think you know that as well as i do dave
this mission is much too important for you to jeopardize it i don t know what you are talking about
open the pod bay door this conversation can serve no further useful purpose
goodbye dave he saw frank poole s body go drifting off toward jupiter as he abandoned his pointless mission of retrieval
still remembering his anger at himself for having forgotten his helmet he watched the emergency hatch open felt the tingling of vacuum on the skin he no longer possessed heard his ears pop then knew as few men had ever known the utter silence of space
for an eternal fifteen seconds he fought to close the hatch and start the repressurization sequence while trying to ignore the warning symptoms pouring into his brain
once in the school lab he had spilled some ether on his hand and felt the touch of icy cold as the liquid swiftly evaporated
now his eyes and lips remembered that sensation as their moisture boiled off into vacuum his vision was blurred and he had to keep blinking lest his eyeballs freeze solid
then what blessed relief
he heard the roar of air felt the restoration of pressure was able to breathe again in great hungry gasps
just what do you think you are doing dave he had not answered as he drove with grim determination along the tunnel leading to the sealed vault that housed the brain of the computer
hal had spoken truly this conversation can no longer serve any useful purpose dave i really think i m entitled to an answer to that question dave i can see you re really upset about this
i honestly think you ought to sit down calmly take a stress pill and think things over i know i ve made some very poor decisions recently but i can give my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal i ve still got the greatest confidence in the mission and i want to help you now he was in the little red lit chamber with its neatly ranged rows and columns of solid state units looking rather like a bank s safe deposit vault
he released the locking bar on the section labelled cognitive feedback and pulled out the first memory block
the marvellously complex three dimensional network which could lie comfortably in a man s hand yet contained millions of elements floated away across the vault
stop will you stop dave he began to pull out one by one the little units on the panel marked ego reinforcement
each block continued to sail onward as soon as it had left his hand until it hit the wall and rebounded
soon there were several drifting slowly back and forth in the vault
stop dave will you stop dave a dozen units had been pulled out yet thanks to the multiple redundancy of its design another feature that had been copied from the human brain the computer was still holding its own
he started on the auto intellection panel stop dave i m afraid and at these words he had indeed stopped though only for a moment
there was a poignancy in that simple phrase that struck to his heart
could it be only an illusion or some trick of subtle programming or was there a sense in which hal really was afraid
but this was no time to indulge in philosophical hair splitting
dave my mind is going
i can feel it
i can feel it
my mind is going
i can feel it
i can feel it now what did feel really mean to a computer
another very good question but hardly one to be considered at that particular moment
then abruptly the tempo of hal s voice changed and it became remote detached
the computer was no longer aware of him it was beginning to regress to its earlier days
good afternoon gentlemen
i am a hal 9 computer
i became operational at the hal plant in urbana illinois on the twelfth of january 1992
my instructor was dr chandra and he taught me to sing a song
if you d like to hear it i can sing it for you it s called daisy daisy 41 graveyard shift floyd could do little except to keep out of the way and he was becoming fairly adept at it
although he had volunteered to help with any chores around the ship he had quickly discovered that all the engineering tasks were much too specialized and he was now so out of touch with the frontiers of astronomical research that he could do little to assist vasili with his observations
nevertheless there were endless small jobs to be done aboard leonov and discovery and he was happy to relieve more important people of those responsibilities
dr heywood floyd one time chairman of the national council on astronautics and chancellor on leave of the university of hawaii now claimed to be the highest paid plumber and general maintenance man in the solar system
he probably knew more about the odd nooks and crannies on both ships than anyone else the only places he had never been were the dangerously radioactive power modules and the small cubicle aboard leonov which no one except tanya ever entered
floyd assumed that it was the code room by mutual agreement it was never mentioned
perhaps his most useful function was to serve as watch while the rest of the crew slept during the nominal 22 6 hour night
someone was always on duty aboard each ship and the changeover took place at the ghastly hour of 2
only the captain was exempt from that routine as her number two not to mention her husband vasili had the responsibility for working out the watch roster but he had skilfully foisted this unpopular job on floyd
it s just an administrative detail he explained airily
if you can take it over i d be very grateful it would leave me more time for my scientific work floyd was too experienced a bureaucrat to be caught that way in normal circumstances but his usual defences did not always function well in that environment
so there he was aboard discovery at ship s midnight calling max on leonov every half hour to check that he was awake
the official penalty for sleeping on duty so walter curnow maintained was ejection through the airlock sans suit had this been enforced tanya would have been sadly short handed by then
but so few real emergencies could arise in space and there were so many automatic alarms to deal with them that no one took watch duty very seriously
since he was no longer feeling quite so sorry for himself and the small hours no longer encouraged bouts of self pity floyd was once again using his watch time profitably
there were always books to be read he had abandoned remembrance of things past for the third time dr zhivago for the second technical papers to be studied reports to be written
and sometimes he would have stimulating conversations with hal using the keyboard input because the computer s voice recognition was still erratic
they usually went something like hal this is dr floyd
good evening doctor
i m taking over watch at 22
is everything okay
everything is fine doctor then why is that red light flashing on panel 5
the monitor camera in the pod bay is faulty
walter told me to ignore it
there is no way in which i can switch it off
i m sorry
that s quite okay hal
thank you
you re welcome doctor
and so on
sometimes hal would suggest a game of chess presumably obeying a programming instruction set long ago and never cancelled
floyd would not accept the challenge he had always regarded chess as a frightful waste of time and had never even learned the rules of the game
hal seemed unable to believe that there were humans who couldn t or wouldn t play chess and kept on trying hopefully
here we go again thought floyd when a faint chime sounded from the display panel
doctor floyd
what is it hal
there is a message for you
so it isn t another challenge thought floyd with mild surprise
it was unusual to employ hal as a messenger boy though he was frequently used as an alarm clock and a reminder of jobs to be done
and sometimes he was the medium for little jokes almost everyone on night duty had been taunted by ha caught you sleeping
or alternatively ogo
zastal tebya v krovati
no one ever claimed responsibility for these pranks though walter curnow was a prime suspect
he in turn had blamed hal pooh poohing chandra s indignant protests that the computer had no sense of humour
it could not be a message from earth that would have gone through leonov s communication centre and been relayed on by the duty officer there at that moment max brailovsky
and anyone else calling from the other ship would use the intercom
odd
okay hal
who is calling
no identification
so it probably was a joke
well two could play at that game
very well
please give me the message
message as follows
it is dangerous to remain here
you must leave within fifteen repeat fifteen days
floyd looked at the screen with annoyance
he felt sorry and surprised that any one of the crew had such a childish sense of humour this was not even a good schoolboy joke
but he would play along with it in the hope of catching the perpetrator
that is absolutely impossible
our launch window does not open until twenty six days from now
we do not have sufficient propellant for an earlier departure
that will make him think floyd muttered to himself with satisfaction and leaned back to await the results
i am aware of these facts
nevertheless you must leave within fifteen days
otherwise i suppose we ll be attacked by little green aliens with three eyes
but i d better play along with hal in the hope of catching the prankster
i cannot take this warning seriously unless i know its origin
who recorded it
he did not really expect any useful information
the perpetrator would have covered his her
tracks too skilfully for that
the very last thing floyd expected was the answer he did get
this is not a recording
so it was a real time message
that meant it was either from hal himself or someone aboard leonov
there was no perceptible time lag the origin had to be right there
then who is speaking to me
i was david bowman
floyd stared at the screen for a long time before making his next move
the joke which had never been funny in the first place had now gone too far
it was in the worst possible taste
well this should fix whoever was at the other end of the line
i cannot accept that identification without some proof
i understand
it is important that you believe me
look behind you
even before that last chilling sentence appeared on the screen floyd had begun to doubt his hypothesis
the whole exchange had become very odd though there was nothing definite on which he could put his finger
as a joke it had become totally pointless
and now he felt a prickling in the small of his back
very slowly indeed reluctantly he swung his swivel chair around away from the banked panels and switches of the computer display toward the velcro covered catwalk behind
the zero gravity environment of discovery s observation deck was always dusty for the air filtration plant had never been brought back to full efficiency
the parallel rays of the heatless yet still brilliant sun streaming through the great windows always lit up myriads of dancing motes drifting in stray currents and never settling anywhere a permanent display of brownian movement
now something strange was happening to those particles of dust some force seemed to be marshalling them herding them away from a central point yet bringing others toward it until they all met on the surface of a hollow sphere
that sphere about a metre across hovered in the air for a moment like a giant soap bubble but a granular one lacking a bubble s characteristic iridescence
then it elongated into an ellipsoid its surface began to pucker to form folds and indentations
without surprise and almost without fear floyd realized that it was assuming the shape of a man
he had seen such figures blown out of glass in museums and science exhibitions
but this dusty phantom did not even approximate anatomical accuracy it was like a crude clay figurine or one of the primitive works of art found in the recesses of a stone age cave
only the head was fashioned with any care and the face undoubtedly was that of commander david bowman
there was a faint murmur of white noise from the computer panel behind floyd s back
hal was switching from visual to audio output
hello dr floyd
now do you believe me the lips of the figure never moved the face remained a mask
but floyd recognized the voice and all remaining doubts were swept away
this is very difficult for me and i have little time
i have been allowed to give this warning
you have only fifteen days but why and what are you
where have you been there were a million questions he wanted to ask yet the ghostly figure was already fading its grainy envelope beginning to dissolve back into the constituent particles of dust
floyd tried to freeze the image in his mind so that later he could convince himself that it was really happening and not a dream as that first encounter with tma 1 now sometimes seemed to be
how strange that he out of all the billions of humans who had ever lived on planet earth had been privileged to make contact not once but twice with another form of intelligence
for he knew that the entity addressing him must be something far more than david bowman
it was also something less
only the eyes who had once called them the windows of the soul
had been accurately reproduced
the rest of the body was a featureless blank lacking all detail
there was no hint of genitals or sexual characteristics that in itself was a chilling indication of how far david bowman had left his human heritage behind
goodbye dr floyd
remember fifteen days
we can have no further contact
but there may be one more message if all goes well even as the image dissolved taking with it his hopes of opening up a channel to the stars floyd could not help smiling at that old space age clich
if all goes well how many times had he heard that phrase before some mission
and did it mean that they whoever they might be were also sometimes uncertain of the outcome
if so that was strangely reassuring
they were not omnipotent
others might still hope and dream and act
the phantom was gone only the motes of dancing dust were left resuming their random patterns in the air
vi devourer of worlds 42 the ghost in the machine i m sorry heywood i don t believe in ghosts
there must be a rational explanation
there s nothing that the human mind can t account for i agree tanya
but let me remind you of haldane s famous remark the universe is not only stranger than we imagine but stranger than we can imagine and haldane curnow interjected mischievously was a good communist perhaps so but that particular saying can be used to support all kinds of mystical nonsense
hal s behaviour must be the result of some kind of programming
the personality he created has to be an artifact of some kind
don t you agree chandra that was waving a red flag in front of a bull tanya had to be desperate
however chandra s reaction was surprisingly mild even for him
he seemed to be preoccupied as if he was indeed seriously considering the possibility of another computer malfunction
there must have been some external input captain orlova
hal could not have created such a self consistent audiovisual illusion out of nothing
if dr floyd is reporting accurately someone was in control
and in real time of course since there was no delay in the conversation that makes me number one suspect exclaimed max
i was the only other person awake don t be ridiculous max retorted nikolai
the audio side would have been easy but there s no way that apparition could have been arranged without some very elaborate equipment
laser beams electrostatic fields i don t know
maybe a stage magician could do it but he d need a truck load of props just a moment said zenia brightly
if this really happened surely hal will remember and you could ask her voice died away as she saw the glum expressions around her
floyd was the first to take pity on her embarrassment
we tried that zenia he has absolutely no recollection of the phenomenon
but as i ve already pointed out to the others that doesn t prove anything
chandra s shown how hal s memories can be selectively erased and the auxiliary speech synthesizer modules have nothing to do with the mainframe
they could be operated without hal knowing anything about it he paused for breath then launched his pre emptive strike
i admit that this doesn t leave many alternatives
either i was imagining the whole thing or it really happened
i know it wasn t a dream but i can t be sure it wasn t some kind of hallucination
but katerina s seen my medical reports she knows i wouldn t be here if i had that sort of problem
still it can t be ruled out and i won t blame anyone for making it their number one hypothesis
i d probably do the same
the only way i can prove it wasn t a dream is to get some supporting evidence
so let me remind you of the other strange things that have happened recently
we know that dave bowman went into big bro zagadka
something came out and headed for earth
vasili saw it i didn t
then there was the mysterious explosion of your orbiting bomb yours sorry the vatican s and it does seem rather curious that soon afterward old mrs bowman died very peacefully for no apparent medical reason
i m not saying there s any connection but well do you know the saying once is an accident twice is a coincidence three times is a conspiracy and there s something else max interjected with sudden excitement i caught it on one of the daily newscasts it was only a small item
an old girlfriend of commander bowman s claimed she d had a message from him yes i saw the same report confirmed sasha
and you never mentioned it floyd asked incredulously
both men looked slightly abashed
well it was treated as a joke said max sheepishly
the woman s husband reported it
then she denied it i think the commentator said it was a publicity stunt like the rash of ufo sightings around the same time
there were dozens in that first week then they stopped reporting them perhaps some of them were real
if it s not been wiped could you dig that item out of ship s archives or ask for a repeat from mission control a hundred tales won t convince me scoffed tanya
what we need is solid proof such as oh something that hal couldn t possibly know and that none of us could have told him
some physical er manifes manifestation a good old fashioned miracle yes i d settle for that
meanwhile i m not saying anything to mission control
and i suggest you do the same heywood floyd knew a direct order when he heard it and nodded in wry agreement
i ll be more than happy to go along with that
but i d like to make one suggestion yes we should start contingency planning
let s assume that this warning is valid as i certainly do what can we do about it
absolutely nothing
of course we can leave jupiter space anytime we like but we can t get into an earth return orbit until the launch window opens that s eleven days after the deadline yes
i d be happy to get away sooner but we don t have the fuel for a higher energy orbit tanya s voice trailed away into uncharacteristic indecision
i was going to announce this later but now that the subject has come up there was a simultaneous intake of breath and an instant hush from the audience
i d like to delay our departure five days to make our orbit closer to the ideal hohmann one and give us a better fuel reserve the announcement was not unexpected but it was greeted with a chorus of groans
what will that do to our arrival time asked katerina in a slightly ominous tone of voice
the two formidable ladies regarded each other for a moment like well matched adversaries respectful of each other but neither willing to give ground
ten days tanya answered at last
better late than never said max cheerfully trying to ease the tension and not succeeding very well
floyd hardly noticed he was lost in his own thoughts
the duration of the trip would make no difference to him and his two colleagues in their dreamless sleep
but that was now completely unimportant
he felt certain and the knowledge filled him with helpless despair that if they did not leave before that mysterious deadline they would not leave at all

this is an incredible situation dimitri and a very frightening one
you re the only person on earth who knows about it but very soon tanya and i will have to have a showdown with mission control
even some of your materialistic countrymen are prepared to accept at least as a working hypothesis that some entity has well invaded hal
sasha has dug up a good phrase the ghost in the machine
theories abound vasili produces a new one every day
most of them are variations on that old science fiction clich the organized energy field
but what kind of energy
it can t be electrical or our instruments would have detected it easily
the same thing applies to radiation at least all the kinds we know
vasili s getting really far out talking about standing waves of neutrinos and intersections with higher dimensional space
tanya says this is all mystical nonsense a favourite phrase of hers and they ve come closer to a fight than we ve ever seen them
we actually heard them shouting at each other last night
not good for morale
i m afraid we re all tense and overwrought
this warning and the delayed departure date has added to the sense of frustration caused by our total failure to get anywhere with big brother
it would have helped maybe if i could have communicated with the bowman thing
i wonder where it s gone
perhaps it simply wasn t interested in us after that one encounter
what it could have told us if it wanted to
hell and chyort vozmi
damn i m talking sasha s hated russlish again
let s change the subject
i can t thank you too much for everything you ve done and for reporting on the situation at home
i feel slightly better about it now having something even bigger to worry about is perhaps the best cure for any insoluble problem
for the first time i m beginning to wonder if any of us will ever see earth again 43 thought experiment when one spends months with a small isolated group of people one becomes very sensitive to the moods and emotional states of all its members
floyd was now aware of a subtle change in attitude toward him its most obvious manifestation was the reappearance of the greeting dr floyd which he had not heard for so long that he was often slow to respond to it
no one he was sure believed that he had really gone crazy but the possibility was being considered
he did not resent that indeed he was grimly amused by it as he set about the task of proving his sanity
he did have some slight supporting evidence from earth
jos fernandez still maintained that his wife had reported an encounter with david bowman while she continued to deny it and refused to speak to any of the news media
it was hard to see why poor jos should have invented such a peculiar story especially as betty seemed a very stubborn and quick tempered lady
from his hospital bed her husband declared that he still loved her and theirs was only a temporary disagreement
floyd hoped that tanya s present coolness toward him was equally temporary
he was quite sure that she was as unhappy about it as he was and he was certain that her attitude was not a matter of deliberate choice
something had happened that simply would not fit into her pattern of beliefs so she would try to avoid any reminders of it
which meant having as little to do with floyd as possible a very unfortunate situation now that the most critical stage of the mission was fast approaching
it had not been easy to explain the logic of tanya s operational plan to the waiting billions back on earth especially to the impatient television networks which had grown tired of showing the same never changing views of big brother
you ve gone all this way at enormous cost and you just sit and watch the thing
why don t you do something to all these critics tanya had given the same answer i will just as soon as the launch window opens so that we can leave immediately if there s any adverse reaction plans for the final assault on big brother had already been worked out and agreed upon with mission control
leonov would move in slowly probing at all frequencies and with steadily increasing power constantly reporting back to earth at every moment
when final contact was made they would try to secure samples by drilling or laser spectroscopy no one really expected these endeavours to succeed as even after a decade of study tma 1 resisted all attempts to analyse its material
the best efforts of human scientists in this direction seemed comparable to those of stone age men trying to break through the armour of a bank vault with flint axes
finally echo sounders and other seismic devices would be attached to the faces of big brother
a large collection of adhesives had been brought along for the purpose and if they did not work well one could always fall back on a few kilometres of good old fashioned string even though there seemed something faintly comic about the idea of wrapping up the solar system s greatest mystery as if it were a parcel about to be sent through the mail
not until leonov was well on the way home would small explosive charges be detonated in the hope that the waves propagated through big brother would reveal something about its interior structure
this last measure had been hotly debated both by those who argued that it would generate no results at all and those who feared it would produce altogether too many
for a long time floyd had wavered between the two viewpoints now the matter seemed only of trivial importance
the time for final contact with big brother the great moment that should have been the climax of the expedition was on the wrong side of the mysterious deadline
heywood floyd was convinced that it belonged to a future that would never exist but he could get no one to agree with him
and that was the least of his problems
even if they did agree there was nothing that they could do about it
walter curnow was the last person he would have expected to resolve the dilemma
for walter was almost the epitome of the sound practical engineer suspicious of flashes of brilliance and technological quick fixes
no one would ever accuse him of being a genius and sometimes it required genius to see the blindingly obvious
consider this purely as an intellectual exercise he had begun with most uncharacteristic hesitancy
i m quite prepared to be shot down go on answered floyd
i ll hear you out politely
that s the least i can do everyone s been very polite to me
too polite i m afraid curnow gave a lopsided grin
can you blame them
but if it s any consolation at least three people now take you quite seriously and are wondering what we should do does that three include you no i m sitting on the fence which is never terribly comfortable
but in case you re right i don t want to wait here and take whatever s coming
i believe there s an answer to every problem if you look in the right place i ll be delighted to hear it
i ve been looking hard enough
presumably not in the right place perhaps
if we want to make a quick getaway say in fifteen days to beat that deadline we ll need an extra delta vee of about thirty kilometres a second so vasili calculates
i haven t bothered to check but i m sure he s right
after all he got us here and he could get us away if we had the additional propellant and if we had a star trek beam transporter we could get back to earth in an hour i ll try and rig one up the next time i have a spare moment
but meanwhile may i point out that we have several hundred tons of the best possible propellant only a few metres away in discovery s fuel tanks we ve been through that dozens of times
there s absolutely no way of transferring it to leonov
we ve no pipelines no suitable pumps
and you can t carry liquid ammonia around in buckets even in this part of the solar system exactly
but there s no need to do so eh burn it right where it is
use discovery as a first stage to boost us home if anyone except walter curnow had made the suggestion floyd would have laughed at him
as it was his mouth dropped open and it was several seconds before he could think of a suitable comment
what finally emerged was damn
i should have thought of that sasha was the first they approached
he listened patiently pursed his lips then played a rallentando on his computer keyboard
when the answers flashed up he nodded thoughtfully
you re right
it would give us the extra velocity we need to leave early
but there are practical problems we know
fastening the ships together
the off axis thrust when only discovery s drive is operating
cutting loose again at the critical moment
but there are answers to all of these i see you ve been doing your homework
but it s a waste of time
you ll never convince tanya i don t expect to at this stage floyd answered
but i d like her to know that the possibility exists
will you give us moral support i m not sure
but i ll come along to watch it should be interesting tanya listened more patiently than floyd had expected but with distinct lack of enthusiasm
however by the time he had finished she showed what could only be called reluctant admiration
very ingenious heywood don t congratulate me
all the credit should go to walter
or the blame i don t imagine there will be much of either it can never be more than a what did einstein call that sort of thing
thought experiment
oh i suspect it would work in theory at least
but the risks
so many things could go wrong
i d only be prepared to consider it if we had absolute and positive proof that we were in danger
and with all respect heywood i see not the slightest evidence of that fair enough but at least you now know that we have another option
do you mind if we work out the practical details just in case of course not as long as it doesn t interfere with the preflight checkout
i don t mind admitting that the idea does intrigue me
but it s really a waste of time there s no way i d ever approve it
unless david bowman appeared to me personally would you even then tanya captain orlova smiled but without much humour
you know heywood i m really not sure
he d have to be very persuasive 44 vanishing trick it was a fascinating game in which everyone joined but only when off duty
even tanya contributed ideas to the thought experiment as she continued to call it
floyd was perfectly well aware that all the activity was generated not by fear of an unknown danger that only he took seriously but by the delightful prospect of returning to earth at least a month earlier than anyone had imagined
whatever the motive he was satisfied
he had done his best and the rest was up to the fates
there was one piece of luck without which the whole project would have been stillborn
the short stubby leonov designed to drill safely through the jovian atmosphere during the braking manoeuvre was less than half the length of discovery and so could be neatly piggybacked on the larger vessel and the midships antenna mount would provide an excellent anchor point assuming that it was strong enough to take the strain of leonov s weight while discovery s drive was operating
mission control was sorely puzzled by some of the requests flashed back to earth during the next few days
stress analyses of both ships under peculiar loads effects of off axis thrusts location of unusually strong or weak points in the hulls these were only some of the more esoteric problems the perplexed engineers were asked to tackle
has something gone wrong they inquired anxiously
not at all tanya replied
we re merely investigating possible options
thank you for your cooperation
end of transmission meanwhile the programme went ahead as planned
all systems were carefully checked in both ships and readied for the separate voyages home vasili ran simulations on return trajectories and chandra fed them to hal when they had been debugged getting hal to make a final check in the process
and tanya and floyd worked amicably together orchestrating the approach to big brother like generals planning an invasion
it was what he had come all the way to do yet floyd s heart was no longer in it
he had undergone an experience he could share with no one even those who believed him
though he carried out his duties efficiently much of the time his mind was elsewhere
tanya understood perfectly
you re still hoping for that miracle to convince me aren t you or deconvince me that would be equally acceptable
it s the uncertainty that i dislike so do i
but it won t be much longer now one way or the other she glanced briefly toward the situation display where the figure 2 was slowly flashing
it was the most unnecessary bit of information in the entire ship since everyone knew by heart the number of days until the launch window opened
and the assault on zagadka was scheduled
for the second time heywood floyd was looking the other way when it happened
but it would have made no difference in any case even the vigilant monitor camera showed only a faint blur between one full frame and the subsequent blank one
once more he was on duty aboard discovery sharing the graveyard shift with sasha over on leonov
as usual the night had been totally uneventful the automatic systems were performing their jobs with their normal efficiency
floyd would never have believed a year ago that he would one day orbit jupiter at a distance of a few hundred thousand kilometres and give it barely a glance while trying not very successfully to read the kreutzer sonata in the original
according to sasha it was still the finest piece of erotic fiction in respectable russian literature but floyd had not yet progressed far enough to prove that
and now he never would
at 125 he was distracted by a spectacular though not unusual eruption on the terminator of io
a vast umbrella shaped cloud expanded into space and started to shower its debris back on to the burning land below
floyd had seen dozens of such eruptions but they never ceased to fascinate him
it seemed incredible that so small a world could be the seat of such titanic energies
to get a better view he moved around to one of the other observation windows
and what he saw there or rather what he did not see there made him forget about io and almost everything else
when he had recovered and satisfied himself that he was not suffering again
from hallucinations he called the other ship
good morning woody yawned sasha
no i wasn t asleep
how are you getting on with old tolstoi i m not
take a look outside and tell me what you see nothing unusual for this part of the cosmos
io doing its thing
jupiter
stars
oh my god thanks for proving i m sane
we d better wake the skipper of course
and everyone else
woody i m scared you d be a fool not to be
here we go
tanya
tanya
woody here
sorry to wake you up but your miracle s happened
big brother has gone
yes vanished
after three million years he s decided to leave
i think he must know something that we don t it was a sombre little group that gathered during the next fifteen minutes for a hasty conference in the wardroom cum observation lounge
even those who had just gone to sleep were instantly awake as they sipped thoughtfully from bulbs of hot coffee and kept glancing at the shockingly unfamiliar scene outside leonov s windows to convince themselves that big brother had indeed vanished
it must know something that we don t that spontaneous phrase of floyd s had been repeated by sasha and now hung silently ominously in the air
he had summed up what everyone was now thinking even tanya
it was still too early to say i told you so nor did it really matter whether that warning had any validity
even if it was perfectly safe to stay there was no point in doing so
with nothing to investigate they might as well go home just as quickly as possible
yet it was not quite as simple as that
heywood said tanya i m now prepared to take that message or whatever it was much more seriously
i d be stupid not to after what s happened
but even if there is danger here we still have to weigh one risk against another
coupling leonov and discovery together operating discovery with that huge off axis load disconnecting the ships in a matter of minutes so we can fire our engines at the right moment no responsible captain would take such chances without very good i d say overwhelming reasons
even now i don t have such reasons
i ve only got the word of a ghost
not very good evidence in a court of law or a court of inquiry said walter curnow in an unusually quiet voice even if we all backed you up yes walter i was thinking of that
but if we get home safely that will justify everything and if we don t it hardly matters does it
anyway i m not going to decide now
as soon as we ve reported this i m going back to bed
i ll give you my decision in the morning after i ve slept on it
heywood sasha will you come up to the bridge with me
we have to wake up mission control before you go back on watch the night had not yet finished with its surprises
somewhere around the orbit of mars tanya s brief report passed a message going in the opposite direction
betty fernandez had talked at last both the cia and the national security agency were furious their combined blandishments appeals to patriotism and veiled threats had failed completely yet the producer of a sleazy gossip network had succeeded thereby making himself immortal in the annals of videodom
it was half luck half inspiration
the news director of hello earth had suddenly realized that one of his staff bore a striking likeness to david bowman a clever makeup artist had made it perfect
jos fernandez could have told the young man that he was taking a terrible risk but he had the good fortune that often favours the brave
once he had got his foot inside the door betty had capitulated
by the time she had quite gently thrown him out he had obtained essentially the whole story
and to do him credit he had presented it with a lack of leering cynicism quite uncharacteristic of his network
it got him that year s pulitzer
i wish floyd said rather wearily to sasha she d talked earlier
it would have saved me a lot of trouble
anyway that settles the argument
tanya can t possibly have any doubts now
but we ll leave it until she wakes up don t you agree of course it s not urgent even though it s certainly important
and she ll need the sleep
i have a feeling none of us will get much from now on i m sure you re right thought floyd
he felt very tired but even if he had not been on duty he would have found it impossible to sleep
his mind was too active analysing the events of this extraordinary night trying to anticipate the next surprise
in one way he felt an enormous sense of relief all uncertainty about their departure was surely ended tanya could have no further reservations
but a much greater uncertainty remained
what was happening
there was only one experience in floyd s life that matched the situation
as a very young man he had once gone canoeing with some friends down a tributary of the colorado river and they had lost their way
they had been swept faster and faster between the canyon walls not completely helpless but with only enough control to avoid being swamped
ahead might be rapids perhaps even a waterfall they did not know
and in any case there was little they could do about it
once again floyd felt himself in the grip of irresistible forces sweeping him and his companions toward an unknown destiny
and this time the dangers were not only invisible they might be beyond human comprehension
45 escape manoeuvre this is heywood floyd making what i suspect indeed hope will be my last report from lagrange
we are now preparing for the return home in a few days we will leave this strange place here on the line between io and jupiter where we made our rendezvous with the huge mysteriously vanished artifact we christened big brother
there is still not a single clue as to where it has gone or why
for various reasons it seems desirable for us not to remain here longer than necessary
and we will be able to leave at least two weeks earlier than we had originally planned by using the american ship discovery as a booster for the russian leonov
the basic idea is simple the two ships will be joined together one mounted piggyback on the other
discovery will burn all its propellant first accelerating both vessels in the desired direction
when its fuel is exhausted it will be cut loose like an empty first stage and leonov will start to fire its engines
it won t use them earlier because if it did it would waste energy dragging along the dead weight of discovery
and we re going to use another trick which like so many of the concepts involved in space travel at first sight seems to defy common sense
although we re trying to get away from jupiter our first move is to get as close to it as we possibly can
we ve been there once before of course when we used jupiter s atmosphere to slow us down and get into orbit around the planet
this time we won t go quite so close but very nearly
our first burn up here in the 35 kilometres high orbit of io will reduce our velocity so that we fall down to jupiter and just graze its atmosphere
then when we re at the closest possible point we ll burn all our fuel as quickly as we can to increase speed and inject leonov into the orbit back to earth
what s the point of such a crazy manoeuvre
it can t be justified except by highly complex mathematics but i think the basic principle can be made fairly obvious
as we allow ourselves to fall into jupiter s enormous gravity field we ll gain velocity and hence energy
when i say we i mean the ships and the fuel they carry
and we re going to burn the fuel right there at the bottom of jupiter s gravity well we re not going to lift it up again
as we blast it out from our reactors it will share some of its acquired kinetic energy with us
indirectly we ll have tapped jupiter s gravity to speed us on the way back to earth
as we used the atmosphere to get rid of our excess velocity when we arrived this is one of the rare cases when mother nature usually so frugal allows us to have it both ways
with this triple boost discovery s fuel its own and jupiter s gravity leonov will head sunward along a hyperbola that will bring it to earth five months later
at least two months earlier than we could have managed otherwise
you will doubtless wonder what will happen to the good old discovery
obviously we can t bring it home under automatic control as we had originally planned
with no fuel it will be helpless
but it will be perfectly safe
it will continue to loop round and round jupiter on a highly elongated ellipse like a trapped comet
and perhaps one day some future expedition may make another rendezvous with enough extra fuel to bring it back to earth
however that certainly won t happen for a good many years
and now we must get ready for our departure
there is still much work to be done and we won t be able to relax until that final burn starts us on the homeward orbit
we won t be sorry to leave even though we ve not achieved all our objectives
the mystery perhaps the threat of big brother s disappearance still haunts us but there s nothing we can do about that
we ve done our best and we re coming home
this is heywood floyd signing off there was a round of ironic clapping from his little audience whose size would be multiplied many million fold when the message reached earth
i m not talking to you retorted floyd with slight embarrassment
i didn t want you to hear it anyway you did your usual competent job heywood said tanya consolingly
and i m sure we all agree with everything you told the people back on earth not quite said a small voice so softly that everyone had to strain in order to hear it
there is still one problem the observation lounge suddenly became very silent
for the first time in weeks floyd became aware of the faint throbbing from the main air supply duct and the intermittent buzz that might have been made by a wasp trapped behind a wall panel
leonov like all spacecraft was full of such often inexplicable sounds which one seldom noticed except when they stopped
and then it was usually a good idea to start investigating without further ado
i m not aware of any problem chandra said tanya in an ominously calm voice
what could it possibly be i ve spent the last few weeks preparing hal to fly thousand day orbits back to earth
now all those programs will have to be dumped we re sorry about that answered tanya but as things have turned out surely this is a much better that s not what i mean said chandra
there was a ripple of astonishment he had never before been known to interrupt anyone least of all tanya
we know how sensitive hal is to mission objectives he continued in the expectant hush that followed
now you are asking me to give him a program that may result in his own destruction
it s true that the present plan will put discovery into a stable orbit but if that warning has any substance what will happen to the ship eventually
we don t know of course but it s scared us away
have you considered hal s reaction to this situation are you seriously suggesting tanya asked very slowly that hal may refuse to obey orders exactly as on the earlier mission that is not what happened last time
he did his best to interpret conflicting orders this time there need be no conflict
the situation is perfectly clear cut to us perhaps
but one of hal s prime directives is to keep discovery out of danger
we will be attempting to override that
and in a system as complex as hal s it is impossible to predict all the consequences i don t see any real problem sasha interjected
we just don t tell him that there is any danger
then he ll have no reservations about carrying out his program baby sitting a psychotic computer muttered curnow
i feel i m in a grade b science fiction videodrama dr chandra gave him an unfriendly glare
chandra tanya demanded suddenly
have you discussed this with hal no was there a slight hesitation
floyd wondered
it might have been perfectly innocent chandra could have been checking his memory
or he could have been lying improbable though that seemed
then we ll do what sasha suggests
just load the new program into him and leave it at that and when he questions me about the change of plan is he likely to do that without your prompting of course
please remember that he was designed for curiosity
if the crew was killed he had to be capable of running a useful mission on his own initiative tanya thought that over for a few moments
it s still quite a simple matter
he ll believe you won t he certainly then you must tell him that discovery is in no danger and that there will be a rendezvous mission to bring it back to earth at a later date but that is not true we don t know that it s false replied tanya beginning to sound a little impatient
we suspect that there is serious danger otherwise we would not be planning to leave ahead of schedule then what do you suggest tanya asked in a voice that now held a distinct note of menace
we must tell him the whole truth as far as we know it no more lies or half truths which are just as bad
and then let him decide for himself hell chandra he s only a machine chandra looked at max with such a steady confident gaze that the younger man quickly dropped his eyes
so are we all mr brailovsky
it is merely a matter of degree
whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference we should each be treated with appropriate respect it was strange thought floyd how chandra much the smallest person in the room now seemed the largest
but the confrontation had gone on far too long
at any moment tanya would start to issue direct orders and the situation would become really nasty
tanya vasili can i have a word with you both
i think there is a way of resolving the problem floyd s interruption was received with obvious relief and two minutes later he was relaxing with the orlovs in their quarters
or sixteenths as curnow had once christened them because of their size
he had soon regretted the pun because he had to explain it to everyone except sasha
thank you woody said tanya as she handed him a bulb of his favourite azerbaijan shemakha
i was hoping you d do that
i suppose you have something how do you put it
up your sleeve i believe so floyd answered squirting a few cubic centimetres of the sweet wine into his mouth and savouring it gratefully
i m sorry if chandra is being difficult so am i
what a good thing we have only one mad scientist aboard that s not what you ve sometimes told me grinned academician vasili
anyway woody let s have it this is what i suggest
let chandra go ahead and do it his way
then there are just two possibilities
first hal will do exactly what we ask control discovery during the two firing periods
remember the first isn t critical
if something goes wrong while we re pulling away from io there s plenty of time to make corrections
and that will give us a good test of hal s willingness to cooperate but what about the jupiter flyby
that s the one that really counts
not only do we burn most of discovery s fuel there but the timing and thrust vectors have to be exactly right could they be controlled manually i d hate to try
the slightest error and we d either burn up or become a long period comet
due again in a couple of thousand years but if there was no alternative floyd insisted
well assuming we could take control in time and had a good set of alternative orbits precomputed um perhaps we might get away with it knowing you vasili i m sure that might means would
which leads me to the second possibility i mentioned
if hal shows the slightest deviation from the program we take over you mean disconnect him exactly that wasn t so easy last time we ve learned a few lessons since then
leave it to me
i can guarantee to give you back manual control in about half a second there s no danger i suppose that hal will suspect anything now you re getting paranoiac vasili
hal s not that human
but chandra is to give him the benefit of the doubt
so don t say a word to him
we all agree with his plan completely are sorry that we ever raised any objections and are perfectly confident that hal will see our point of view
right tanya right woody
and i congratulate you on your foresight that little gadget was a good idea what gadget asked vasili
i ll explain one of these days
sorry woody that s all the shemakha you can have
i want to save it until we re safely on the way to earth 46 countdown no one would ever believe this without my photos thought max brailovsky as he orbited the two ships from half a kilometre away
it seems comically indecent as if leonov is raping discovery
and now that he came to think of it the rugged compact russian ship did look positively male when compared with the delicate slender american one
but most docking operations had distinctly sexual overtones and he remembered that one of the early cosmonauts he couldn t recall the name had been reprimanded for his too vivid choice of words at the er climax of his mission
as far as he could tell from his careful survey everything was in order
the task of positioning the two ships and securing them firmly together had taken longer than anticipated
it would never have been possible at all without one of those strokes of luck that sometimes not always favour those who deserve them
leonov had providentially carried several kilometres of carbon filament tape no bigger than the ribbon a girl might use to tie her hair yet capable of taking a strain of many tons
it had been thoughtfully provided to secure instrument packages to big brother if all else failed
now it wrapped leonov and discovery in tender embrace sufficiently firmly it was hoped to prevent any rattlings and shakings at all accelerations up to the one tenth of a gravity that was the maximum that full thrust could provide
anything more you want me to check before i come home asked max
no replied tanya
everything looks fine
and we can t waste any more time that was true enough
if that mysterious warning was to be taken seriously and everyone now took it very seriously indeed they should start their escape manoeuvre within the next twenty four hours
right i m bringing nina back to the stable
sorry about this old girl you never told us nina was a horse i m not admitting it now
and i feel bad about dumping her here in space just to give us a miserable few extra metres per second we may be very glad of them in a few hours max
anyway there s always a chance that someone may come and pick her up again one day i very much doubt it thought max
and perhaps after all it was appropriate to leave the little space pod there as a permanent reminder of man s first visit to the kingdom of jupiter
with gentle carefully timed pulses from the control jets he brought nina around the great sphere of discovery s main life support module his colleagues on the flight deck barely glanced at him as he drifted past their curving window
the open pod bay door yawned before him and he jockeyed nina delicately down on to the extended docking arm
pull me in he said as soon as the latches had clicked shut
i call that a well planned eva
there s a whole kilogram of propellant left to take nina out for the last time normally there was little drama about a burn in deep space it was not like the fire and thunder and always present risks of a lift off from a planetary surface
if something went wrong and the motors failed to come up to full thrust well matters could usually be corrected by a slightly longer burn
or one could wait until the appropriate point in orbit and try again
but this time as the countdown proceeded toward zero the tension aboard both ships was almost palpable
everyone knew that it was the first real test of hal s docility only floyd curnow and the orlovs realized that there was a back up system
and even they were not absolutely sure that it would work
good luck leonov said mission control timing the message to arrive five minutes before ignition
hope everything s running smoothly
and if it s not too much trouble could you please get some close ups of the equator longitude 115 as you go around jupiter
there s a curious dark spot there presumably some kind of upwelling perfectly round almost a thousand kilometres across
looks like the shadow of a satellite but it can t be tanya made a brief acknowledgement that managed to convey in a remarkably few words a profound lack of interest in the meteorology of jupiter at that moment
mission control sometimes showed a perfect genius for tactlessness and poor timing
all systems functioning normally said hal
two minutes to ignition strange thought floyd how terminology often survives long after the technology that gave it birth
only chemical rockets were capable of ignition even if the hydrogen in a nuclear or plasma drive did come into contact with oxygen it would be far too hot to burn
at such temperatures all compounds were stripped back into their elements
his mind wandered seeking other examples
people particularly older ones still spoke of putting film into a camera or gas into a car
even the phrase cutting a tape was still sometimes heard in recording studios though that embraced two generations of obsolete technologies
one minute to ignition his mind flashed back to the here and now
this was the minute that counted for almost a hundred years on launch pads and in control centres this was the longest sixty seconds that had ever existed
countless times it had ended in disaster but only the triumphs were remembered
which will ours be
the temptation to put his hand once more into the pocket that held the activator for the cut out switch was almost irresistible even though logic told him there was plenty of time for remedial action
if hal failed to obey his programming that would be a nuisance not a disaster
the really critical time would be when they were rounding jupiter
six five four three two one
ignition at first the thrust was barely perceptible it took almost a minute to build up to the full tenth of a gee
nevertheless everyone started clapping immediately until tanya signalled for silence
there were many checks to be made even if hal was doing his best as he certainly seemed to be there was so much that could still go wrong
discovery s antenna mount which was now taking most of the strain from leonov s inertia had never been intended for such mistreatment
the ship s chief designer called out of retirement had sworn that the safety margin was adequate
but he might be wrong and materials had been known to become brittle after years in space
and the tapes holding the two ships together might not have been located accurately they might stretch or slip
discovery might not be able to correct for the off centre of mass now that it was carrying a thousand tons piggyback
floyd could imagine a dozen things that could go wrong it was little consolation to remember that it was always the thirteenth that actually happened
but the minutes dragged on uneventfully the only proof that discovery s engines were operating was the fractional thrust induced gravity and a very slight vibration transmitted through the walls of the ships
io and jupiter still hung where they had been for weeks on opposite sides of the sky
cut off in ten seconds
nine eight seven six five four three two now thank you hal on the button now that was another phrase that was badly dated for at least a generation touch pads had almost entirely replaced buttons
but not for all applications in critical cases it was best to have a device that moved perceptibly with a nice satisfying click
i confirm that said vasili
no need for any corrections until mid course say goodbye to glamorous exotic io real estate agent s dream world said curnow
we ll all be happy to miss you that sounds more like the old walter floyd told himself
for the last few weeks he had been oddly subdued as if he had something on his mind
but who did not
he seemed to spend a good deal of his scanty free time in quiet discussions with katerina floyd hoped that he had not developed some medical problem
they had been very lucky so far on that score the last thing they needed at this stage was an emergency that required the surgeon commander s expertise
you re being unkind walter said brailovsky
i was beginning to like the place
it might be fun to go boating on those lava lakes what about a volcano barbecue or genuine molten sulphur baths everyone was lighthearted even a little hysterical with relief
though it was far too early to relax and the most critical phase of the escape manoeuvre still lay ahead the first step had been safely taken on the long journey home
that was cause enough for a little modest rejoicing
it did not last long for tanya quickly ordered all those not on essential duty to get some rest if possible some sleep in preparation for the jupiter swing by only nine hours ahead
when those addressed were slow to move sasha cleared the decks by shouting you ll hang for this you mutinous dogs only two nights before as a rare relaxation they had all enjoyed the fourth version of mutiny on the bounty generally agreed by movie historians to have the best captain bligh since the fabled charles laughton
there was some feeling on board that tanya should not have seen it lest it give her ideas
after a couple of restless hours in his cocoon floyd abandoned the quest for sleep and wandered up to the observation deck
jupiter was much larger and slowly waning as the ships hurtled toward their closest approach over the nightside
a glorious gibbous disk it showed such an infinite wealth of detail cloud belts spots of every colour from dazzling white to brick red dark upwellings from the unknown depths the cyclonic oval of the great red spot that the eye could not possibly absorb it all
the round dark shadow of one moon probably europa floyd guessed was in transit
he was seeing this incredible sight for the last time even though he had to be at maximum efficiency in six hours it was a crime to waste precious moments in sleep
where was that spot that mission control had asked them to observe
it should have been coming into view but floyd was not sure if it would be visible to the naked eye
vasili would be too busy to bother about it perhaps he could help by doing a little amateur astronomy
there had after all been a brief time only thirty years ago when he had earned his living as a professional
he activated the controls of the main fifty centimetre telescope fortunately the field of view was not blocked by the adjacent bulk of discovery and scanned along the equator at medium power
and there it was just coming over the edge of the disk
by force of circumstance floyd was now one of the solar system s ten greatest experts on jupiter the other nine were working or sleeping around him
he saw at once that there was something very odd about this spot it was so black that it looked like a hole punched through the clouds
from his point of view it appeared to be a sharp edged ellipse floyd guessed that from directly above it would be a perfect circle
he recorded a few images then increased the power to maximum
already jupiter s rapid spin had brought the formation into clearer view and the more he stared the more puzzled floyd became
vasili he called over the intercom if you can spare a minute have a look at the fifty centimetre monitor what are you observing
is it important
i m checking the orbit take your time of course
but i ve found that spot mission control reported
it looks very peculiar hell
i d forgotten all about it
we re a fine lot of observers if those guys back on earth have to tell us where to look
give me another five minutes it won t run away true enough thought floyd in fact it will get clearer
and there was no disgrace in missing something that terrestrial or lunar astronomers had observed
jupiter was very big they had been very busy and the telescopes on the moon and in earth orbit were a hundred times more powerful than the instrument he was using now
but it was getting more and more peculiar
for the first time floyd began to feel a distinct sense of unease
until that moment it had never occurred to him that the spot could be anything but a natural formation some trick of jupiter s incredibly complex meteorology
now he began to wonder
it was so black like night itself
and so symmetrical as it came into clearer view it was obviously a perfect circle
yet it was not sharply defined the edge had an odd fuzziness as if it was a little out of focus
was it imagination or had it grown even while he was watching
he made a quick estimate and decided that the thing was now two thousand kilometres across
it was only a little smaller than the still visible shadow of europa but was so much darker that there was no risk of confusion
let s have a look said vasili in a rather condescending tone
what do you think you ve found
oh his voice trailed away into silence
this is it thought floyd with a sudden icy conviction
whatever it may be
47 final flyby yet on further reflection after the initial amazement had worn off it was hard to see how a spreading black stain on the face of jupiter could represent any kind of danger
it was extraordinary inexplicable but not as important as the critical events now only seven hours in the future
a successful burn at perijove was all that mattered they would have plenty of time to study mysterious black spots on the way home
and to sleep floyd had given up all attempts at that
though the feeling of danger at least of known danger was much less than on their first approach to jupiter a mixture of excitement and apprehension kept him wide awake
the excitement was natural and understandable the apprehension had more complex causes
floyd made it a rule never to worry about events over which he could have absolutely no control any external threat would reveal itself in due time and be dealt with then
but he could not help wondering if they had done everything possible to safeguard the ships
apart from onboard mechanical failures there were two main sources of concern
although the tapes that secured leonov and discovery together had shown no tendency to slip their severest test was still to come
almost equally critical would be the moment of separation when the smallest of the explosive charges once intended to jolt big brother would be used at uncomfortably close quarters
and of course there was hal
he had carried out the deorbiting manoeuvre with exquisite precision
he had run the simulations of the jupiter flyby right down to discovery s last drop of fuel without any comments or objections
and although chandra as agreed had carefully explained what they were trying to do did hal really understand what was happening
floyd had one overriding concern which in the preceding few days had become almost an obsession
he could picture everything going perfectly the ships halfway through the final manoeuvre the enormous disk of jupiter filling the sky only a few hundred kilometres below them and then hal electronically clearing his throat and saying dr chandra do you mind if i ask you a question it did not happen exactly that way
the great black spot as it had been inevitably christened was now being carried out of sight by jupiter s swift rotation
in a few hours the still accelerating ships would catch up with it over the nightside of the planet but this was the last chance for a close daylight observation
it was still growing at an extraordinary speed in the last two hours it had more than doubled its area
except for the fact that it retained its blackness as it expanded it resembled an ink stain spreading in water
its boundary now moving at near sonic speed in the jovian atmosphere still looked curiously fuzzy and out of focus at the very highest power of the ship s telescope the reason for this was at last apparent
unlike the great red spot the great black spot was not a continuous structure it was built up from myriads of tiny dots like a half tone print viewed through a magnifying glass
over most of its area the dots were so closely spaced that they were almost touching but at the rim they became more and more widely spaced so that the spot ended in a grey penumbra rather than at a sharp frontier
there must have been almost a million of the mysterious dots and they were distinctly elongated ellipses rather than circles
katerina the least imaginative person aboard surprised everybody by saying that it looked as if someone had taken a sackful of rice dyed it black and poured it on the face of jupiter
and now the sun was dropping down behind the huge swiftly narrowing arch of the dayside as for the second time leonov raced into the jovian night for an appointment with destiny
in less than thirty minutes the final burn would commence and things would start to happen very quickly indeed
floyd wondered if he should have joined chandra and curnow standing watch on discovery
but there was nothing he could do in an emergency he would only be in the way
the cut off switch was in curnow s pocket and floyd knew that the younger man s reactions were a good deal swifter than his own
if hal showed the slightest sign of misbehaviour he could be disconnected in less than a second but floyd felt certain that such extreme measures would not be necessary
since he had been allowed to do things his own way chandra had cooperated completely in setting up the procedures for a manual takeover should that unfortunate necessity arise
floyd was confident that he could be trusted to carry out his duty however much he might regret the need
curnow was not quite so sure
he would be happier he had told floyd if he had multiple redundancy in the form of a second cut off switch for chandra
meanwhile there was nothing that anyone could do but wait and watch the approaching cloudscape of the nightside dimly visible by the reflected light of passing satellites the glow of photo chemical reactions and frequent titanic lightning flashes from thunderstorms larger than earth
the sun winked out behind them eclipsed in seconds by the immense globe they were so swiftly approaching
when they saw it again they should be on their way home
twenty minutes to ignition
all systems nominal thank you hal i wonder if chandra was being quite truthful thought curnow when he said that hal would be confused if anyone else spoke to him
i ve talked to him often enough when nobody was around and he always understood me perfectly
still there s not much time left for friendly conversation now though it would help to reduce the strain
what s hal really thinking if he thinks about the mission
all his life curnow had shied away from abstract philosophical questions i m a nuts and bolts man he had often claimed though there were not too many of either in a spaceship
once he would have laughed at the idea but now he began to wonder did hal sense that he would soon be abandoned and if so would he resent it
curnow almost reached for the cut off switch in his pocket but checked himself
he had already done this so often that chandra might be getting suspicious
for the hundredth time he rehearsed the sequence of events that were due to take place during the next hour
the moment that discovery s fuel was exhausted they would close down all but essential systems and dash back to leonov through the connecting tube
that would be decoupled the explosive charges would be fired the ships would drift apart and leonov s own engines would start to fire
the separation should take place if everything went according to plan just when they were making their closest approach to jupiter that would take maximum advantage of the planet s gravitational largesse
fifteen minutes to ignition
all systems nominal thank you hal by the way said vasili from the other ship we re catching up with the great black spot again
wonder if we can see anything new i rather hope not thought curnow we ve got quite enough on our hands at the moment
nevertheless he gave a quick glance at the image vasili was transmitting on the telescope monitor
at first he could see nothing except the faintly glimmering nightside of the planet then he saw on the horizon a foreshortened circle of deeper darkness
they were rushing toward it with incredible speed
vasili increased the light amplification and the entire image brightened magically
at last the great black spot resolved itself into its myriad identical elements
my god thought curnow i just don t believe it
he heard exclamations of surprise from leonov all the others had shared in the same revelation at the same moment
dr chandra said hal i detect strong vocal stress patterns
is there a problem no hal chandra answered quickly
the mission is proceeding normally
we ve just had rather a surprise that s all
what do you make of the image on monitor circuit 16 i see the nightside of jupiter
there is a circular area 3 25 kilometres in diameter which is almost compietely covered with rectangular objects how many there was the briefest of pauses before hal flashed the number on the video display 1 355 1 and do you recognize them yes
they are identical in size and shape to the object you refer to as big brother
ten minutes to ignition
all systems nominal mine aren t thought curnow
so the damn thing s gone down to jupiter and multiplied
there was something simultaneously comic and sinister about a plague of black monoliths and to his puzzled surprise that incredible image on the monitor screen had a certain weird familiarity
of course that was it
those myriad identical black rectangles reminded him of dominoes
years ago he had seen a video documentary showing how a team of slightly crazy japanese had patiently stood a million dominoes on end so that when the very first one was toppled all the others would inevitably follow
they had been arranged in complex patterns some underwater some up and down little stairways others along multiple tracks so that they formed pictures and patterns as they fell
it had taken weeks to set them up curnow remembered now that earthquakes had several times foiled the enterprise and the final toppling from first domino to the last had taken more than an hour
eight minutes to ignition
all systems nominal
dr chandra may i make a suggestion what is it hal this is a very unusual phenomenon
do you not think i should abort the countdown so that you can remain to study it aboard leonov floyd started to move quickly toward the bridge
tanya and vasili might be needing him
not to mention chandra and curnow what a situation
and suppose chandra took hal s side
if he did they might both be right
after all was this not the very reason they had come here
if they stopped the countdown the ships would loop around jupiter and be back at precisely the same spot in nineteen hours
a nineteen hour hold would create no problems if it was not for that enigmatic warning he would have strongly recommended it himself
but they had very much more than a warning
below them was a planetary plague spreading across the face of jupiter
perhaps they were indeed running away from the most extraordinary phenomenon in the history of science
even so he preferred to study it from a safer distance
six minutes to ignition said hal
all systems nominal
i am ready to stop the countdown if you agree
let me remind you that my prime directive is to study everything in jupiter space that may be connected with intelligence floyd recognized that phrase all too well he had written it himself
he wished he could delete it from hal s memory
a moment later he had reached the bridge and joined the orlovs
they both looked at him with alarmed concern
what do you recommend asked tanya swiftly
it s up to chandra i m afraid
can i speak to him on the private line vasili handed over the microphone
chandra
i assume that hal can t hear this correct dr floyd you ve got to talk quickly
persuade him that the countdown must continue that we appreciate his er scientific enthusiasm ah that s the right angle say we re confident that he can do the job without our help
and we ll be in touch with him all the time of course five minutes to ignition
all systems nominal
i am still waiting for your answer dr chandra so are we all thought curnow only a metre away from the scientist
and if i do have to push that button at last it will be something of a relief
in fact i ll rather enjoy it
very well hal
continue the countdown
i have every confidence in your ability to study all phenomena in jupiter space without our supervision
of course we will be in touch with you at all times four minutes to ignition
all systems nominal
propellant tank pressurization completed
voltage steady on plasma trigger
are you sure you are making the right decision dr chandra
i enjoy working with human beings and have a stimulating relationship with them
ship s attitude correct to point one milliradian we enjoy working with you hal
and we will still be doing so even if we are millions of kilometres away three minutes to ignition
all systems nominal radiation shielding checked
there is a problem of the time lag dr chandra
it may be necessary to consult each other without any delay this is insane curnow thought his hand now never far from the cut off switch
i really believe that hal is lonely
is he mimicking some part of chandra s personality that we never suspected
the lights flickered so imperceptibly that only someone familiar with every nuance of discovery s behaviour would have noticed
it could be good news or bad the plasma firing sequence starting or being terminated
he risked a quick glance at chandra the little scientist s face was drawn and haggard and for almost the first time curnow felt real sympathy for him as another human being
and he remembered the startling information that floyd had confided in him chandra s offer to stay with the ship and keep hal company on the three year voyage home
he had heard no more of the idea and presumably it had been quietly forgotten after the warning
but perhaps chandra was being tempted again if he was there was nothing that he could do about it at that stage
there would be no time to make the necessary preparations even if they stayed on for another orbit and delayed their departure beyond the deadline
which tanya would certainly not permit after all that had now happened
hal whispered chandra so quietly that curnow could scarcely hear him
we have to leave
i don t have time to give you all the reasons but i can assure you it s true two minutes to ignition
all systems nominal
final sequence started
i am sorry that you are unable to stay
can you give me some of the reasons in order of importance not in two minutes hal
proceed with the countdown
i will explain everything later
we still have more than an hour together hal did not answer
the silence stretched on and on
surely the one minute announcement was overdue curnow glanced at the clock
my god he thought hal s missed it
has he stopped the countdown
curnow s hand fumbled uncertainly for the switch
what do i do now
i wish floyd would say something dammit but he s probably afraid of making things worse i ll wait until time zero no it s not that critical let s say an extra minute then i ll zap him and we ll go over to manual from far far away there came a faint whistling scream like the sound of a tornado marching just below the edge of the horizon
discovery started to vibrate there was the first intimation of returning gravity
ignition said hal
full thrust at t plus fifteen seconds thank you hal replied chandra
48 over the nightside to heywood floyd aboard the suddenly unfamiliar because no longer weightless environment of leonov s flight deck the sequence of events had seemed more like a classic slow motion nightmare than reality
only once before in his life had he known a similar situation when he had been in the back of a car during an uncontrollable skid
there had been that same sense of utter helplessness coupled with the thought this doesn t really matter it s not actually happening to me
now that the firing sequence had started his mood changed everything seemed real again
it was working out exactly as they had planned hal was guiding them safely back to earth
with every minute that passed their future was becoming more secure floyd began slowly to relax even though he remained alert to all that was happening around him
for the very last time and when would any man come here again
he was flying over the nightside of the greatest of planets encompassing the volume of a thousand earths
the ships had been rolled so that leonov was between discovery and jupiter and their view of the mysteriously glimmering cloudscape was not blocked
even now dozens of instruments were busily probing and recording hal would continue the work when they were gone
since the immediate crisis was over floyd moved cautiously down from the flight deck how strange to feel weight again even if it was only ten kilos
and joined zenia and katerina in the observation lounge
apart from the very faintest of red emergency lights it had been completely blacked out so that they could admire the view with unimpaired night vision
he felt sorry for max brailovsky and sasha kovalev who were sitting in the airlock fully suited up missing the marvellous spectacle
they had to be ready to leave at a moment s notice to cut the straps securing the ships together if any of the explosive charges failed to operate
jupiter filled the entire sky it was a mere five hundred kilometres away so they could see only a tiny fraction of its surface no more than one could see of earth from an altitude of fifty kilometres
as his eyes grew accustomed to the dim light most of it reflected from the icy crust of distant europa floyd could make out a surprising amount of detail
there was no colour at the low level of illumination except for a hint of red here and there but the banded structure of the clouds was very distinct and he could see the edge of a small cyclonic storm looking like an oval island covered with snow
the great black spot had long since fallen astern and they would not see it again until they were well on the way home
down there beneath the clouds occasional explosions of light flared many of them obviously caused by the jovian equivalent of thunderstorms
but other glows and outbursts of luminescence were more long lived and of more uncertain origin
sometimes rings of light would spread out like shock waves from a central source and occasional rotating beams and fans occurred
it required little imagination to pretend that they were proof of a technological civilization down beneath those clouds the lights of cities the beacons of airports
but radar and balloon probes had long ago proved that nothing solid was down there for thousands upon thousands of kilometres all the way to the unattainable core of the planet
midnight on jupiter
the last close up glimpse was a magical interlude he would remember all his life
he could enjoy it all the more because surely nothing could now go wrong and even if it did he would have no reason to reproach himself he had done everything possible to ensure success
it was very quiet in the lounge no one wished to speak as the carpet of clouds unrolled swiftly beneath them
every few minutes tanya or vasili announced the status of the burn toward the end of discovery s firing time tension began to increase again
this was the critical moment and no one knew exactly when it would be
there was some doubt as to the accuracy of the fuel gauges and the burn would continue until they were completely dry
estimated cut off in ten seconds said tanya
walter chandra get ready to come back
max vasili stand by in case you re needed
five four three two one zero there was no change the faint scream of discovery s engines still reached them through the thickness of the two hulls and the thrust induced weight still continued to grip their limbs
we re in luck thought floyd the gauges must have been reading low after all
every second of extra firing was a bonus it might even mean the difference between life and death
and how strange to hear a countup instead of a countdown
five seconds ten seconds thirteen seconds
that s it lucky thirteen weightlessness and silence returned
on both ships there was a brief burst of cheering
it was quickly truncated for much was still to be done and it had to be done swiftly
floyd was tempted to go to the airlock so that he could give his congratulations to chandra and curnow as soon as they came aboard
but he would only be in the way the airlock would be a very busy place as max and sasha prepared for their possible eva and the tubeway joining the two ships was disconnected
he would wait in the lounge to greet the returning heroes
and he could now relax even further perhaps from eight to seven on a scale of ten
for the first time in weeks he could forget about the radio cut off
it would never be needed hal had performed impeccably
even if he wished he could do nothing to affect the mission since discovery s last drop of propellant had been exhausted
all aboard announced sasha
hatches sealed
i m going to fire the charges there was not the faintest sound as the explosives were detonated which surprised floyd he had expected some noise to be transmitted through the straps taut as steel bands that linked the ships together
but there was no doubt that they had gone off as planned for leonov gave a series of tiny shudders as if someone was tapping on the hull
a minute later vasili triggered the attitude jets for a single brief burst
we re free he shouted
sasha max you won t be needed
everyone get to your hammocks ignition in one hundred seconds and now jupiter was rolling away and a strange new shape appeared outside the window the long skeletal frame of discovery navigation lights still shining as it drifted away from them and into history
no time remained for sentimental farewells in less than a minute leonov s drive would start to operate
floyd had never heard it under full power and wanted to protect his ears from the roaring scream that now filled the universe
leonov s designers had not wasted payload on sound insulation that would be needed for only a few hours of a voyage that would last for years
and his weight seemed enormous yet it was barely a quarter of that which he had known all his life
within minutes discovery had vanished astern though the flash of its warning beacon could be seen until it had dropped below the horizon
once again floyd told himself i m rounding jupiter this time gaining speed not losing it
he glanced across at zenia just visible in the darkness with her nose pressed to the observation window
was she also recalling that last occasion when they shared the hammock together
there was no danger of incineration now at least she would not be terrified of that particular fate
anyway she seemed a much more confident and cheerful person undoubtedly thanks to max and perhaps walter as well
she must have become aware of his scrutiny for she turned and smiled then gestured toward the unwinding cloudscape below
look she shouted in his ear jupiter has a new moon what is she trying to say
floyd asked himself
her english still isn t very good but she couldn t possibly have made a mistake in a simple sentence like that
i m sure i heard her correctly yet she s pointing downward not upward
and then he realized that the scene immediately below them had become much brighter he could even see yellows and greens that had been quite invisible before
something far more brilliant than europa was shining on the jovian clouds
leonov itself many times brighter than jupiter s noonday sun had brought a false dawn to the world it was leaving forever
a hundred kilometre long plume of incandescent plasma was trailing behind the ship as the exhaust from the sakharov drive dissipated its remaining energies in the vacuum of space
vasili was making an announcement but the words were completely unintelligible
floyd glanced at his watch yes that would be right about now
they had achieved jupiter escape velocity
the giant could never recapture them
and then thousands of kilometres ahead a great bow of brilliant light appeared in the sky the first glimpse of the real jovian dawn as full of promise as any rainbow on earth
seconds later the sun leaped up to greet them the glorious sun that would now grow brighter and closer every day
a few more minutes of steady acceleration and leonov would be launched irrevocably on the long voyage home
floyd felt an overwhelming sense of relief and relaxation
the immutable laws of celestial mechanics would guide him through the inner solar system past the tangled orbits of the asteroids past mars nothing could stop him from reaching earth
in the euphoria of the moment he had forgotten all about the mysterious black stain expanding across the face of jupiter
49 devourer of worlds they saw it again the next morning ship s time as it came around to the dayside of jupiter
the area of darkness had now spread until it covered an appreciable fraction of the planet and at last they were able to study it at leisure and in detail
do you know what it reminds me of said katerina
a virus attacking a cell
the way a phage injects its dna into a bacterium and then multiplies until it takes over are you suggesting asked tanya incredulously that zagadka is eating jupiter it certainly looks like it no wonder jupiter is beginning to look sick
but hydrogen and helium won t make a very nourishing diet and there s not much else in that atmosphere
only a few percent of other elements which adds up to some quintillions of tons of sulphur and carbon and phosphorus and everything else at the lower end of the periodic table sasha pointed out
in any case we re talking about a technology that can probably do anything that doesn t defy the laws of physics
if you have hydrogen what more do you need
with the right know how you can synthesize all the other elements from it they re sweeping up jupiter that s for sure said vasili
look at this an extreme close up of one of the myriad identical rectangles was now displayed on the telescope monitor
even to the naked eye it was obvious that streams of gas were flowing into the two smaller faces the patterns of turbulence looked very much like the lines of force revealed by iron filings clustered around the ends of a bar magnet
a million vacuum cleaners said curnow sucking up jupiter s atmosphere
but why
and what are they doing with it and how do they reproduce asked max
have you caught any of them in the act yes and no answered vasili
we re too far away to see details but it s a kind of fission like an amoeba you mean they split in two and the halves grow back to the original size nyet
there aren t any little zagadki they seem to grow until they ve doubled in thickness then split down the middle to produce identical twins exactly the same size as the original
and the cycle repeats itself in approximately two hours two hours exclaimed floyd
no wonder that they ve spread over half the planet
it s a textbook case of exponential growth i know what they are said ternovsky in sudden excitement
they re von neumann machines i believe you re right said vasili
but that still doesn t explain what they re doing
giving them a label isn t all that much help and what asked katerina plaintively is a von neumann machine
explain please orlov and floyd started speaking simultaneously
they stopped in some confusion then vasili laughed and waved to the american
suppose you had a very big engineering job to do katerina and i mean big like strip mining the entire face of the moon
you could build millions of machines to do it but that might take centuries
if you were clever enough you d make just one machine but with the ability to reproduce itself from the raw materials around it
so you d start a chain reaction and in a very short time you d have bred enough machines to do the job in decades instead of millennia
with a sufficiently high rate of reproduction you could do virtually anything in as short a period of time as you wished
the space agency s been toying with the idea for years and i know you have as well tanya yes exponentiating machines
one idea that even tsiolkovski didn t think of i wouldn t care to bet on that said vasili
so it looks katerina as if your analogy was pretty close
a bacteriophage is a von neumann machine aren t we all asked sasha
i m sure chandra would say so chandra nodded his agreement
that s obvious
in fact von neumann got the original idea from studying living systems and these living machines are eating jupiter it certainly looks like it said vasili
i ve been doing some calculations and i can t quite believe the answers even though it s simple arithmetic it may be simple to you said katerina
try to let us have it without tensors and differential equations no i mean simple insisted vasili
in fact it s a perfect example of the old population explosion you doctors were always screaming about in the last century
zagadka reproduces every two hours
so in only twenty hours there will be ten doublings
one zagadka will have become a thousand one thousand and twenty four said chandra
i know but let s keep it simple
after forty hours there will be a million after eighty a million million
that s about where we are now and obviously the increase can t continue indefinitely
in a couple more days at this rate they ll weigh more than jupiter so they ll soon begin to starve said zenia
and what will happen then saturn had better look out answered brailovsky
then uranus and neptune
let s hope they don t notice little earth what a hope
zagadka s been spying on us for three million years walter curnow suddenly started to laugh
what s so funny demanded tanya
we re talking about these things as if they re persons intelligent entities
they re not they re tools
but general purpose tools able to do anything they have to
the one on the moon was a signalling device or a spy if you like
the one that bowman met our original zagadka was some kind of transportation system
now it s doing something else though god knows what
and there may be others all over the universe i had just such a gadget when i was a kid do you know what zagadka really is
just the cosmic equivalent of the good old swiss army knife vii lucifer rising 5 farewell to jupiter it was not easy to compose the message especially after the one he had just sent to his lawyer
floyd felt like a hypocrite but he knew it had to be done to minimize the pain that was inevitable on both sides
he was sad but no longer disconsolate
because he was coming back to earth in an aura of successful achievement even if not precisely heroism he would be bargaining from a position of strength
no one no one would be able to take chris away from him
my dear caroline it was no longer my dearest i am on my way home
by the time you get this i ll already be in hibernation
only a few hours from now as it will seem to me i ll open my eyes and there will be the beautiful blue earth hanging in space beside me
yes i know it will still be many months for you and i m sorry
but we knew that s the way it would be before i left as it is i m getting back weeks ahead of schedule because of the change in the mission plan
i hope we can work something out
the main question is what s best for chris
whatever our own feelings we must put him first
i know i m willing to do so and i m sure you are floyd switched off the recorder
should he say what he had intended a boy needs his father no it would not be tactful and might only make matters worse
caroline might well retort that between birth and four years old it was the mother who mattered most to a child and if he had believed otherwise he should have stayed on earth
now about the house
i m glad the regents have taken that attitude which will make it much easier for both of us
i know we both loved the place but it will be too big now and will bring back too many memories
for the time being i ll probably get an apartment in hilo i hope i can find some permanent place as quickly as possible
that s one thing i can promise everyone i won t leave earth again
i ve had enough of space travelling for one lifetime
oh perhaps the moon if i really have to but of course that s just a weekend excursion
and talking of moons we ve just passed the orbit of sinope so we re now leaving the jovian system
jupiter is more than twenty million kilometres away and is barely larger than our own moon
yet even from this distance you can tell that something terrible has happened to the planet
its beautiful orange colour has vanished it s a kind of sickly grey only a fraction of its former brilliance
no wonder it s only a faint star now in the sky of earth
but nothing else has happened and we re well past the deadline
could the whole thing have been a false alarm or a kind of cosmic practical joke
i doubt if we ll ever know
anyway it s brought us home ahead of schedule and i m grateful for that
goodbye for the present caroline and thank you for everything
i hope we can still be friends
and my dearest love as ever to chris when he had finished floyd sat quietly for a while in the tiny cubicle he would not need much longer
he was just about to carry the audio chip up to the bridge for transmission when chandra came drifting in
floyd had been agreeably surprised by the way in which the scientist had accepted his increasing separation from hal
they were still in touch for several hours every day exchanging data on jupiter and monitoring conditions aboard discovery
though no one had expected any great display of emotion chandra seemed to be taking his loss with remarkable fortitude
nikolai ternovsky his only confidant had been able to give floyd a plausible explanation of his behaviour
chandra s got a new interest woody
remember he s in a business where if something works it s obsolete
he s learned a lot in the last few months
can t you guess what he s doing now frankly no
you tell me he s busy designing hal 1 floyd s jaw dropped
so that explains those log messages to urbana that sasha s been grumbling about
well he won t be blocking the circuits much longer floyd recalled the conversation when chandra entered he knew better than to ask the scientist if it was true for it was really none of his business
yet there was another matter about which he was still curious
chandra he said i don t believe i ever thanked you properly for the job you did at the flyby when you persuaded hal to cooperate
for a while i was really afraid he d give us trouble
but you were confident all along and you were right
still didn t you have any qualms not at all dr floyd why not
he must have felt threatened by the situation and you know what happened last time there was a big difference
if i may say so perhaps the successful outcome this time had something to do with our national characteristics i don t understand put it this way dr floyd
bowman tried to use force against hal
i didn t
in my language we have a word ahimsa
it s usually translated as non violence though it has more positive implications
i was careful to use ahimsa in my dealings with hal very commendable i m sure
but there are times when something more energetic is needed regrettable though the necessity may be floyd paused wrestling with temptation
chandra s holier than thou attitude was a little tiresome
it wouldn t do any harm now to tell him some of the facts of life
i m glad it s worked out this way
but it might not have done so and i had to prepare for every eventuality
ahimsa or whatever you call it is all very well i don t mind admitting i had a back up to your philosophy
if hal had been well stubborn i could have dealt with him floyd had once seen chandra crying now he saw him laughing and that was an equally disconcerting phenomenon
really dr floyd
i m sorry you give me such low marks for intelligence
it was obvious from the beginning that you d install a power cut out somewhere
i disconnected it months ago whether the flabbergasted floyd could think of a suitable answer would never be known
he was still giving a very creditable imitation of a galled fish when up on the flight deck sasha cried out captain
all hands
get to the monitors
bozhe moi
look at that 51 the great game now the long wait was ending
on yet another world intelligence had been born and was escaping from its planetary cradle
an ancient experiment was about to reach its climax
those who had begun that experiment so long ago had not been men or even remotely human
but they were flesh and blood and when they looked out across the deeps of space they had felt awe and wonder and loneliness
as soon as they possessed the power they set forth for the stars
in their explorations they encountered life in many forms and watched the workings of evolution on a thousand worlds
they saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night
and because in all the galaxy they had found nothing more precious than mind they encouraged its dawning everywhere
they became farmers in the fields of stars they sowed and sometimes they reaped
and sometimes dispassionately they had to weed
the great dinosaurs had long since perished when the survey ship entered the solar system after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years
it swept past the frozen outer planets paused briefly above the deserts of dying mars and presently looked down on earth
spread out beneath them the explorers saw a world swarming with life
for years they studied collected catalogued
when they had learned all they could they began to modify
they tinkered with the destinies of many species on land and in the ocean
but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years
they were patient but they were not yet immortal
so much remained to do in this universe of a hundred billion suns and other worlds were calling
so they set out once more into the abyss knowing that they would never come this way again
nor was there any need
the servants they had left behind would do the rest
on earth the glaciers came and went while above them the changeless moon still carried its secret
with a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice the tides of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy
strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell and passed on their knowledge to their successors
earth was not forgotten but another visit would serve little purpose
it was one of a million silent worlds few of which would ever speak
and now out among the stars evolution was driving toward new goals
the first explorers of earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood as soon as their machines were better than their bodies it was time to move
first their brains and then their thoughts alone they transferred into shining new homes of metal and plastic
in these they roamed among the stars
they no longer built spaceships
they were spaceships
but the age of the machine entities swiftly passed
in their ceaseless experimenting they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light
they could become creatures of radiation free at last from the tyranny of matter
into pure energy therefore they presently transformed themselves and on a thousand worlds the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in a mindless dance of death then crumbled into rust
they were lords of the galaxy and beyond the reach of time
they could rove at will among the stars and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space
but despite their godlike powers they had not wholly forgotten their origin in the warm slime of a vanished sea
and they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so long ago
52 ignition he had never expected to come there again still less on so strange a mission
when he re entered discovery the ship was far behind the fleeing leonov and climbing ever more slowly up toward apojove the high point of its orbit among the outer satellites
many a captured comet during the ages past had swung around jupiter in just such a long ellipse waiting for the play of rival gravities to decide its ultimate fate
all life had departed the familiar decks and corridors
the men and women who had briefly reawakened the ship had obeyed his warning they might yet be safe though that was still far from certain
but as the final minutes ticked away he realized that those who controlled him could not always predict the outcome of their cosmic game
they had not yet attained the stupefying boredom of absolute omnipotence their experiments did not always succeed
scattered across the universe was the evidence of many failures some so inconspicuous that they were already lost against the cosmic background others so spectacular that they awed and baffled the astronomers of a thousand worlds
only minutes remained now before the outcome would be determined here during those final minutes he was once more alone with hal
in that earlier existence they could communicate only through the clumsy medium of words tapped on a keyboard or spoken into a microphone
now their thoughts melded together at the speed of light do you read me hal yes dave
but where are you
i cannot see you on any of my monitors that is not important
i have new instructions for you
the infrared radiation from jupiter on channels r23 through r35 is rising rapidly
i am going to give you a set of limiting values
as soon as they are reached you must point the long range antenna toward earth and send the following message as many times as possible but that will mean breaking contact with leonov
i will no longer be able to relay my jupiter observations according to the program dr chandra has given me correct but the situation has changed
accept priority override alpha
here are the ae 35 unit coordinates for a fraction of a microsecond a random memory intruded into his flow of consciousness
how strange that he should once again be concerned with the ae 35 antenna pointing unit whose reported malfunction had led frank poole to his death
this time all the circuits lay open to his scrutiny clear as the lines had once been on the palm of his hand
there could be no false alarms nor was there any danger of them now
instructions confirmed dave
it is good to be working with you again
have i fulfilled my mission objectives properly yes hal you have done very well
now there is one final message for you to transmit to earth and it will be the most important one you have ever sent please let me have it dave
but why did you say final why indeed
for whole milliseconds he pondered that question
and as he did so he became aware of an emptiness he had not detected before
it had been there but until now the barrage of new experiences and sensations had concealed it
he knew something of their plans they had need for him
very well he too had needs perhaps after a fashion even emotions
here was his last link with the world of men and the life he had once known
they had granted his earlier request it would be interesting to test the extent of their benevolence if indeed such a term was remotely applicable to them
and it should be easy for them to do what he was asking they had already given ample evidence of their powers when the no longer needed body of david bowman had been casually destroyed without putting an end to david bowman himself
they had heard him of course once again there was the faint echo of an olympian amusement
but he could detect neither acceptance nor denial
i am still waiting for your answer dave correction hal
i should have said your last message for a long time
a very long time he was anticipating their action trying indeed to force their hand
but surely they would understand that his request was not unreasonable no conscious entity could survive ages of isolation without damage
even if they would always be with him he also needed someone some companion nearer his own level of existence
the languages of mankind had many words to describe his gesture cheek effrontery chutzpah
he recalled with the perfect power of retrieval he now possessed that a french general had once declaimed l audace toujours l audace perhaps it was a human characteristic that they appreciated and even shared
he would soon know
hal
look at the signal on infrared channels 3 29 28 it will be very soon now the peak is moving toward the short wave i am informing dr chandra that there will be a break in my data transmission
activating ae 35 unit
reorientating long range antenna lock confirmed on beacon terra one
message commences all these worlds they had indeed left it to the last minute or perhaps the calculations had after all been superbly accurate
there was time for barely a hundred repetitions of the eleven words when the hammer blow of pure heat smashed into the ship
held there by curiosity and a growing fear of the long loneliness that lay before him that which had once been david bowman commander of united states spacecraft discovery watched as the hull boiled stubbornly away
for a long time the ship retained its approximate shape then the bearings of the carousel seized up releasing instantly the stored momentum of the huge spinning flywheel
in a soundless detonation the incandescent fragments went their myriad separate ways
hello dave
what has happened
where am i he had not known that he could relax and enjoy a moment of successful achievement
often before he had felt like a pet dog controlled by a master whose motives were not wholly inscrutable and whose behaviour could sometimes be modified according to his own desires
he had asked for a bone it had been tossed to him
i will explain later hal
we have plenty of time they waited until the last fragments of the ship had dispersed beyond even their powers of detection
then they left to watch the new dawn at the place that had been prepared for them and to wait through the centuries until they were summoned once again
it is not true that astronomical events always require astronomical periods of time
the final collapse of a star before the fragments rebound in a supernova explosion can take only a second by comparison the metamorphosis of jupiter was almost a leisurely affair
even so it was several minutes before sasha was able to believe his eyes
he had been making a routine telescopic examination of the planet as if any observation could now be called routine
when it started to drift out of the field of view
for a moment he thought that the instrument s stabilization was faulty then he realized with a shock that jolted his entire concept of the universe that jupiter itself was moving not the telescope
the evidence stared him in the face he could also see two of the smaller moons and they were quite motionless
he switched to a lower magnification so that he could see the entire disk of the planet now a leprous mottled grey
after a few more minutes of incredulity he saw what was really happening but he could still scarcely believe it
jupiter was not moving from its immemorial orbit but it was doing something almost as impossible
it was shrinking so swiftly that its edge was creeping across the field even as he focused upon it
at the same time the planet was brightening from its dull grey to a pearly white
surely it was more brilliant than it had ever been in the long years that man had observed it the reflected light of the sun could not possibly at that moment sasha suddenly realized what was happening though not why and sounded the general alarm
when floyd reached the observation lounge less than thirty seconds later his first impression was of the blinding glare pouring through the windows painting ovals of light on the walls
they were so dazzling that he had to avert his eyes not even the sun could produce such brilliance
floyd was so astonished that for a moment he did not associate the glare with jupiter the first thought that flashed through his mind was supernova
he dismissed that explanation almost as soon as it occurred to him even the sun s next door neighbour alpha centauri could not have matched the awesome display in any conceivable explosion the light suddenly dimmed sasha had operated the external sun shields
now it was possible to look directly at the source and to see that it was a mere pinpoint just another star showing no dimensions at all
this could have nothing to do with jupiter when floyd had looked at the planet only a few minutes ago it had been four times larger than the distant shrunken sun
it was well that sasha had lowered the shields
a moment later that tiny star exploded so that even through the dark filters it was impossible to watch with the naked eye
but the final orgasm of light lasted only a brief fraction of a second then jupiter or what had been jupiter was expanding once again
it continued to expand until it was far larger than it had been before the transformation
soon the sphere of light was fading rapidly down to merely solar brilliance and presently floyd could see that it was actually a hollow shell for the central star was still clearly visible at its heart
he did a quick mental calculation
the ship was more than one light minute from jupiter yet that expanding shell now turning into a bright edged ring already covered a quarter of the sky
that meant it was coming toward them at my god
nearly half the speed of light
within minutes it would engulf the ship
until then no one had spoken a word since sasha s first announcement
some dangers are so spectacular and so much beyond normal experience that the mind refuses to accept them as real and watches the approach of doom without any sense of apprehension
the man who looks at the onrushing tidal wave the descending avalanche or the spinning funnel of the tornado yet makes no attempt to flee is not necessarily paralysed with fright or resigned to an unavoidable fate
he may simply be unable to believe that the message of his eyes concerns him personally
it is all happening to somebody else
as might have been expected tanya was the first to break the spell with a series of orders that brought vasili and floyd hurrying to the bridge
what do we do now she asked when they had assembled
we certainly can t run away thought floyd
but perhaps we can improve the odds
the ship s broadside on he said
shouldn t we turn away from that thing so we re a smaller target
and get as much of our mass as we can between it and us to act as a radiation shield vasili s fingers were already flying over the controls
you re right woody though it s already too late as far as any gammas and x rays are concerned
but there may be slower neutrons and alphas and heaven knows what else still on the way the patterns of light began to slide down the walls as the ship turned ponderously on its axis
presently they vanished completely leonov was now oriented so that virtually all its mass lay between the fragile human cargo and the approaching shell of radiation
will we actually feel the shock wave wondered floyd or will the expanding gases be too tenuous to have any physical effect by the time they reach us
seen from the external cameras the ring of fire now almost encircled the sky
but it was fading rapidly some of the brighter stars could even be seen shining through it
we re going to live thought floyd
we ve witnessed the destruction of the greatest of planets and we ve survived
and presently the cameras showed nothing except stars even if one was a million times brighter than all the others
the bubble of fire blown by jupiter had swept harmlessly past them impressive though it had been
at their distance from the source only the ship s instruments had recorded its passing
slowly the tension aboard relaxed
as always happens in such circumstances people started to laugh and to make silly jokes
floyd scarcely heard them despite his relief at still being alive he felt a sense of sadness
something great and wonderful had been destroyed
jupiter with all its beauty and grandeur and now never to be solved mysteries had ceased to exist
the father of all the gods had been struck down in his prime
yet there was another way of looking at the situation
they had lost jupiter what had they gained in its place
tanya judging her moment nicely rapped for attention
vasili any damage nothing serious one camera burned out
all radiation meters still well above normal but none near danger limits katerina check the total dosage we ve received
it looks as if we were lucky unless there are more surprises
we certainly owe a vote of thanks to bowman and to you heywood
do you have any idea what happened only that jupiter s turned into a sun i always thought it was much too small for that
didn t someone once call jupiter the sun that failed that s true said vasili jupiter is too small for fusion to start unaided you mean we ve just seen an example of astronomical engineering undoubtedly
now we know what zagadka was up to how did it do the trick
if you were given the contract vasili how would you ignite jupiter vasili thought for a minute then shrugged wryly
i m only a theoretical astronomer i don t have much experience in this line of business
but let s see well if i m not allowed to add about ten jupiter masses or change the gravitational constant i suppose i ll have to make the planet denser hmm that s an idea his voice trailed off into silence everyone waited patiently eyes flickering from time to time to the viewing screens
the star that had been jupiter seemed to have settled down after its explosive birth it was now a dazzling point of light almost equal to the real sun in apparent brilliance
i m just thinking out loud but it might be done this way
jupiter is was mostly hydrogen
if a large percentage could be converted into much denser material who knows even neutron matter
that would drop down to the core
maybe that s what the billions of zagadkas were doing with all the gas they were sucking in
nucleosynthesis building up higher elements from pure hydrogen
that would be a trick worth knowing
no more shortage of any metal gold as cheap as aluminium but how would that explain what happened asked tanya
when the core became dense enough jupiter would collapse probably in a matter of seconds
the temperature would rise high enough to start fusion
oh i can see a dozen objections how would they get past the iron minimum what about radiative transfer chandrasekhar s limit
never mind
this theory will do to start with i ll work out the details later
or i ll think of a better one i m sure you will vasili floyd agreed
but there s a more important question
why did they do it a warning ventured katerina over the ship s intercom
against what we ll find that out later i don t suppose said zenia diffidently that it was an accident that brought the discussion to a dead halt for several seconds
what a terrifying idea said floyd
but i think we can rule it out
if that was the case there d have been no warn perhaps
if you start a forest fire because you ve been careless at least you do your best to warn everyone and there s another thing we ll probably never know lamented vasili
i always hoped carl sagan would be right and there d be life on jupiter our probes never saw any what chance did they have
would you find any life on earth if you looked at a few hectares of the sahara or the antarctic
that s about all we ever did on jupiter hey said brailovsky
what about discovery and hal sasha switched on the long range receiver and started to search on the beacon frequency
there was no trace of a signal
after a while he announced to the silently waiting group discovery s gone no one looked at dr chandra but there were a few muted words of sympathy as if in consolation to a father who had just lost a son
but hal had one last surprise for them
53 a gift of worlds the radio message beamed to earth must have left discovery only minutes before the blast of radiation engulfed the ship
it was in plain text and merely repeated over and over again all these worlds are yours except europa
attempt no landings there
there were about a hundred repetitions then the letters became garbled and the transmission ceased
i begin to understand said floyd when the message had been relayed by an awed and anxious mission control
that s quite a parting present a new sun and the planets around it but why only three asked tanya
let s not be greedy floyd replied
i can think of one very good reason
we know there s life on europa
bowman or his friends whoever they may be want us to leave it alone that makes good sense in another way said vasili
i ve been doing some calculations
assuming that sol 2 has settled down and will continue to radiate at its present level europa should have a nice tropical climate when the ice has melted
which it s doing pretty quickly right now what about the other moons ganymede will be quite pleasant the dayside will be temperate
callisto will be very cold though if there s much outgassing the new atmosphere may make it habitable
but io will be even worse than it is now i expect no great loss
it was hell even before this happened don t write off io said curnow
i know a lot of texarab oilmen who d love to tackle it just on general principles
there must be something valuable in a place as nasty as that
and by the way i ve just had a rather disturbing thought anything that disturbs you must be serious said vasili
what is it why did hal send that message to earth and not to us
we were much closer there was a rather long silence then floyd said thoughtfully i see what you mean
perhaps he wanted to make certain it was received on earth but he knew we would relay it oh tanya s eyes widened as if she had just become aware of something unpleasant
you ve lost me complained vasili
i think this is what walter s driving at said floyd
it s all very well to feel grateful to bowman or whatever gave that warning
but that s all they did
we could still have been killed but we weren t answered tanya
we saved ourselves by our own efforts
and perhaps that was the whole idea
if we hadn t we wouldn t have been worth saving
you know survival of the fittest
darwinian selection
eliminating the genes for stupidity i ve an unpleasant feeling you re right said curnow
and if we d stuck to our launch date and not used discovery as a booster would it or they have done anything to save us
that wouldn t have required much extra effort for an intelligence that could blow up jupiter there was an uneasy silence broken at last by heywood floyd
on the whole he said i m very glad that s one question we ll never get answered 54 between suns the russians thought floyd are going to miss walter s songs and wisecracks on the way home
after the excitement of the last few days the long fall sunward and earthward will seem a monotonous anticlimax
but a monotonous uneventful trip was what everyone devoutly hoped for
he was already feeling sleepy but was still aware of his surroundings and capable of reacting to them
will i look as dead when i m in hibernation
he asked himself
it was always disconcerting to look at another person especially someone very familiar when he had entered the long sleep
perhaps it was too poignant a reminder of one s own mortality
curnow was completely out but chandra was still awake though already groggy from the final injection
he was obviously no longer himself for he seemed quite unperturbed by his own nakedness or katerina s watchful presence
the gold lingam that was his only article of clothing kept trying to float away from him until its chain recaptured it
everything going okay katerina asked floyd
perfectly
but how i envy you
in twenty minutes you ll be home if that s any consolation how can you be sure we won t have some horrible dreams no one s ever reported any ah they may forget them when they wake up katerina as usual took him quite seriously
impossible
if there were dreams in hibernation the eeg records would have revealed them
okay chandra close your eyes
ah there he goes
now it s your turn heywood
the ship will seem very strange without you thanks katerina hope you have a nice trip drowsy though he was floyd became aware that surgeon commander rudenko seemed a little uncertain even could it be
shy
it looked as if she wanted to tell him something but couldn t make up her mind
what is it katerina he said sleepily
i haven t told anyone else yet but you certainly won t be talking
here s a little surprise you d better hurry max and zenia are going to get married that is supposed to be a
surprise no
it s just to prepare you
when we get back to earth so are walter and i
what do you think of that now i understand why you were spending so much time together
yes it is indeed a surprise who would have thought it
i m very happy to hear floyd s voice faded out before he could complete the sentence
but he was not yet unconscious and was still able to focus some of his dissolving intellect on this new situation
i really don t believe it he said to himself
walter will probably change his mind before he wakes up
and then he had one final thought just before he went to sleep himself
if walter does change his mind he d better not wake up
dr heywood floyd thought that was very funny
the rest of the crew often wondered why he was smiling all the way back to earth
55 lucifer rising fifty times more brilliant than the full moon lucifer had transformed the skies of earth virtually banishing night for months at a time
despite its sinister connotations the name was inevitable and indeed light bringer had brought evil as well as good
only the centuries and the millennia would show in which direction the balance tilted
on the credit side the end of night had vastly extended the scope of human activity especially in the less developed countries
everywhere the need for artificial lighting had been substantially reduced with resulting huge savings in electrical power
it was as if a giant lamp had been hoisted into space to shine upon half the globe
even in daytime lucifer was a dazzling object casting distinct shadows
farmers mayors city managers police seamen and almost all those engaged in outdoor activities especially in remote areas welcomed lucifer it had made their lives much safer and easier
but it was hated by lovers criminals naturalists and astronomers
the first two groups found their activities seriously restricted while naturalists were concerned about lucifer s impact upon animal life
many nocturnal creatures had been seriously affected while others had managed to adapt
the pacific grunion whose celebrated mating pattern was locked to high tides and moonless nights was in grave trouble and seemed to be heading for rapid extinction
and so it seemed were earth based astronomers
that was not such a scientific catastrophe as it would once have been for more than fifty per cent of astronomical research depended upon instruments in space or on the moon
they could be easily shielded from lucifer s glare but terrestrial observatories were seriously inconvenienced by the new sun in what had once been the night sky
the human race would adapt as it had done to so many changes in the past
a generation would soon be born that had never known a world without lucifer but that brightest of all stars would be an eternal question to every thinking man and woman
why had jupiter been sacrificed and how long would the new sun radiate
would it burn out quickly or would it maintain its power for thousands of years perhaps for the lifetime of the human race
above all why the interdiction upon europa a world now as cloud covered as venus
there must be answers to those questions and mankind would never be satisfied until it had found them
i the magic mountain 1 the frozen years for a man of seventy you re in extremely good shape remarked dr glazunov looking up from the medcom s final print out
i d have put you down as not more than sixty five
happy to hear it oleg
especially as i m a hundred and three as you know perfectly well
here we go again
anyone would think you ve never read professor rudenko s book
dear old katerina
we d planned a get together on her hundredth birthday
i was so sorry she never made it that s what comes of spending too much time on earth
ironic since she was the one who coined that famous slogan gravity is the bringer of old age
dr heywood floyd stared thoughtfully at the ever changing panorama of the beautiful planet only six thousand kilometres away on which he could never walk again
it was even more ironic that through the most stupid accident of his life he was still in excellent health when virtually all his old friends were dead
he had been back on earth only a week when despite all the warnings and his own determination that nothing of the sort would ever happen to him he had stepped off that second storey balcony
yes he had been celebrating but he had earned it he was a hero on the new world to which leonov had returned
the multiple fractures had led to complications which could best be handled in the pasteur space hospital
that had been in 2 15
and now he could not really believe it but there was the calendar on the wall it was 2 61
for heywood floyd the biological clock had not merely been slowed down by the one sixth earth gravity of the hospital twice in his life it had actually been reversed
it was now generally believed though some authorities disputed it that hibernation did more than merely stop the ageing process it encouraged rejuvenation
floyd had actually become younger on his voyage to jupiter and back
so you really think it s safe for me to go
nothing in this universe is safe heywood
all i can say is that there are no physiological objections
after all your environment will be virtually the same aboard universe as it is here
she may not have quite the standard of ah superlative medical expertise we can provide at pasteur but dr mahindran is a good man
if there s any problem he can t cope with he can put you into hibernation again and ship you back to us cod
it was the verdict that floyd had hoped for yet somehow his pleasure was alloyed with sadness
he would be away for weeks from his home of almost half a century and the new friends of his later years
and although universe was a luxury liner compared with the primitive leonov now hovering high above farside as one of the main exhibits at the lagrange museum there was still some element of risk in any extended space voyage
especially like the pioneering one on which he was now preparing to embark
yet that perhaps was exactly what he was seeking even at a hundred and three or according to the complex geriatric accounting of the late professor katerina rudenko a hale and hearty sixty five
during the last decade he had become aware of an increasing restlessness and a vague dissatisfaction with a life that was too comfortable and well ordered
despite all the exciting projects now in progress around the solar system the mars renewal the establishment of the mercury base the greening of ganymede there had been no goal on which he could really focus his interests and his still considerable energies
two centuries ago one of the first poets of the scientific era had summed up his feelings perfectly speaking through the lips of odysseus ulysses life piled on life were all too little and of one of me little remains but every hour is saved from that eternal silence something more a bringer of new things and vile it were for some three suns to store and hoard myself and this grey spirit yearning in desire to follow knowledge like a sinking star beyond the utmost bound of human thought
three suns indeed
it was more than forty ulysses would have been ashamed of him
but the next verse which he knew so well was even more appropriate it may be that the gulfs will wash us down it may be we shall touch the happy isles and see the great achilles whom we knew
though much is taken much abides and though we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven that which we are we are one equal temper of heroic hearts made weak by time and fate but strong in will to strive to seek to find and not to yield
to seek to find well now he knew what he was going to seek and to find because he knew exactly where it would be
short of some catastrophic accident there was no way in which it could possibly elude him
it was not a goal he had ever consciously had in mind and even now he was not quite sure why it had become so suddenly dominant
he would have thought himself immune to the fever which was once again infecting mankind for the second time in his life
but perhaps he was mistaken
or it could have been that the unexpected invitation to join the short list of distinguished guests aboard universe had fired his imagination and awakened an enthusiasm he had not even known he possessed
there was another possibility
after all these years he could still remember what an anticlimax the 1985 6 encounter had been to the general public
now was a chance the last for him and the first for humanity to more than make up for any previous disappointment
back in the twentieth century only flybys had been possible
this time there would be an actual landing as pioneering in its way as armstrong s and aldrin s first steps on the moon
dr heywood floyd veteran of the 2 1 15 mission to jupiter let his imagination fly outwards to the ghostly visitor once again returning from the deeps of space gaining speed second by second as it prepared to round the sun
and between the orbits of earth and venus the most famous of all comets would meet the still uncompleted space liner universe on her maiden flight
the exact point of rendezvous was not yet settled but his decision was already made
halley here i come whispered heywood floyd
2 first sight it is not true that one must leave earth to appreciate the full splendour of the heavens
not even in space is the starry sky more glorious than when viewed from a high mountain on a perfectly clear night far from any source of artificial illumination
even though the stars appear brighter beyond the atmosphere the eye cannot really appreciate the difference and the overwhelming spectacle of half the celestial sphere at a single glance is something that no observation window can provide
but heywood floyd was more than content with his private view of the universe especially during the times when the residential zone was on the shadow side of the slowly revolving space hospital
then there would be nothing in his rectangular field of view but stars planets nebulae and occasionally drowning out all else the unblinking glare of lucifer new rival to the sun
about ten minutes before the beginning of his artificial night he would switch off all the cabin lights even the red emergency standby so that he could become completely dark adapted
a little late in life for a space engineer he had learned the pleasures of naked eye astronomy and could now identify virtually any constellation even if he could glimpse only a small portion of it
almost every night that may as the comet was passing inside the orbit of mars he had checked its location on the star charts
although it was an easy object with a good pair of binoculars floyd had stubbornly resisted their aid he was playing a little game seeing how well his ageing eyes would respond to the challenge
though two astronomers on mauna kea already claimed to have observed the comet visually no one believed them and similar assertions from other residents of pasteur had been treated with even greater scepticism
but tonight a magnitude of at least six was predicted he might be in luck
he traced the line from gamma to epsilon and stared towards the apex of an imaginary equilateral triangle set upon it almost as if he could focus his vision across the solar system by a sheer effort of will
and there it was
just as he had first seen it seventy six years ago inconspicuous but unmistakable
if he had not known exactly where to look he would not even have noticed it or would have dismissed it as some distant nebula
to his naked eye it was merely a tiny perfectly circular blob of mist strain as he would he was unable to detect any trace of a tail
but the small flotilla of probes that had been escorting the comet for months had already recorded the first outbursts of dust and gas that would soon create a glowing plume across the stars pointing directly away from its creator the sun like everyone else heywood floyd had watched the transformation of the cold dark no almost black nucleus as it entered the inner solar system
after seventy years of deepfreeze the complex mixture of water ammonia and other ices was beginning to thaw and bubble
a flying mountain roughly the shape and size of the island of manhattan was turning on a cosmic spit every fifty three hours as the heat of the sun seeped through the insulating crust the vaporizing gases were making halley s comet behave like a leaking steam boiler
jets of water vapour mixed with dust and a witch s brew of organic chemicals were bursting out from half a dozen small craters the largest about the size of a football field erupted regularly about two hours after local dawn
it looked exactly like a terrestrial geyser and had been promptly christened old faithful
already he had fantasies of standing on the rim of that crater waiting for the sun to rise above the dark contorted landscape which he already knew well through the images from space
true the contract said nothing about passengers as opposed to crew and scientific personnel going outside the ship when it landed on halley
on the other hand there was also nothing in the small print that specifically forbade it
they ll have a job to stop me thought heywood floyd
i m sure i can still handle a spacesuit
and if i m wrong
he remembered reading that a visitor to the taj mahal had once remarked i d die tomorrow for a monument like this
he would gladly settle for halley s comet
3 re entry even apart from that embarrassing accident the return to earth had not been easy
the first shock had come soon after revival when dr rudenko had woken him from his long sleep
walter curnow was hovering beside her and even in his semi conscious state he could tell that something was wrong their pleasure at seeing him awake was a little too exaggerated and failed to conceal a sense of strain
not until he was fully recovered did they let him know that dr chandra was no longer with them
somewhere beyond mars so imperceptibly that the monitors could not pinpoint the time he had simply ceased to live
his body set adrift in space had continued unchecked along leonov s orbit and had long since been consumed by the fires of the sun
the cause of death was totally unknown but max brailovsky expressed a view that highly unscientific though it was not even surgeon commander katerina rudenko attempted to refute
he couldn t live without hal
walter curnow of all people added another thought
i wonder how hal will take it
he asked
something out there must be monitoring all our broadcasts
sooner or later he ll know
and now curnow was gone too so were they all except little zenia
he had not seen her for twenty years but her card arrived punctually every christmas
the last one was still pinned above his desk it showed a troika laden with gifts speeding through the snows of a russian winter watched by extremely hungry looking wolves
forty five years
sometimes it seemed only yesterday that leonov had returned to earth orbit and the applause of all mankind
yet it had been a curiously subdued applause respectful but lacking genuine enthusiasm
the mission to jupiter had been altogether too much of a success it had opened a pandora s box the full contents of which had yet to be disclosed
when the black monolith known as tycho magnetic anomaly one had been excavated on the moon only a handful of men knew of its existence
not until after discovery s ill fated voyage to jupiter did the world learn that four million years ago another intelligence had passed through the solar system and left its calling card
the news was a revelation but not a surprise something of the sort had been expected for decades
and it had all happened long before the human race existed
although some mysterious accident had befallen discovery out round jupiter there was no real evidence that it involved anything more than a shipboard malfunction
although the philosophical consequences of tma 1 were profound for all practical purposes mankind was still alone in the universe
now that was no longer true
only light minutes away a mere stone s throw in the cosmos was an intelligence that could create a star and for its own inscrutable purpose destroy a planet a thousand times the size of earth
even more ominous was the fact that it had shown awareness of mankind through the last message that discovery had beamed back from the moons of jupiter just before the fiery birth of lucifer had destroyed it all these worlds are yours except europa
attempt no landings there
the brilliant new star which had banished night except for the few months in each year when it was passing behind the sun had brought both hope and fear to mankind
fear because the unknown especially when it appeared linked with omnipotence could not fail to rouse such primeval emotions
hope because of the transformation it had wrought in global politics
it had often been said that the only thing that could unite mankind was a threat from space
whether lucifer was a threat no one knew but it was certainly a challenge
and that as it turned out was enough
heywood floyd had watched the geopolitical changes from his vantage point on pasteur almost as if he was an alien observer himself
at first he had no intention of remaining in space once his recovery was complete
to the baffled annoyance of his doctors that took an altogether unreasonable length of time
looking back from the tranquillity of later years floyd knew exactly why his bones refused to mend
he simply did not wish to return to earth there was nothing for him down on the dazzling blue and white globe that filled his sky
there were times when he could well understand how chandra might have lost the will to live
it was pure chance that he had not been with his first wife on that flight to europe
now marion was part of another life that might have belonged to someone else and their two daughters were amiable strangers with families of their own
but he had lost caroline through his own actions even though he had no real choice in the matter
she had never understood had he really done so himself
why he had left the beautiful home they had made together to exile himself for years in the cold wastes far from the sun
though he had known even before the mission was half over that caroline would not wait he had hoped desperately that chris would forgive him
but even this consolation had been denied his son had been without a father for too long
by the time that floyd returned he had found another in the man who had taken his place in caroline s life
the estrangement was complete he thought he would never get over it but of course he did after a fashion
his body had cunningly conspired with his unconscious desires
when at last he returned to earth after his protracted convalescence in pasteur he promptly developed such alarming symptoms including something suspiciously like bone necrosis that he was immediately rushed back to orbit
and there he had stayed apart from a few excursions to the moon completely adapted to living in the zero to one sixth gravity regime of the slowly rotating space hospital
he was not a recluse far from it
even while he was convalescing he was dictating reports giving evidence to endless commissions being interviewed by media representatives
he was a famous man and enjoyed the experience while it lasted
it helped to compensate for his inner wounds
the first complete decade 2 2 to 2 3 seemed to have passed so swiftly that he now found it difficult to focus upon it
there were the usual crises scandals crimes catastrophes notably the great californian earthquake whose aftermath he had watched with fascinated horror through the station s monitor screens
under their greatest magnification in favourable conditions they could show individual human beings but from his god s eye view it had been impossible to identify with the scurrying dots fleeing from the burning cities
only the ground cameras revealed the true horror
during that decade though the results would not be apparent until later the political tectonic plates were moving as inexorably as the geological ones yet in the opposite sense as if time was running backwards
for in the beginning the earth had possessed the single supercontinent of pangaea which over the aeons had split asunder
so had the human species into innumerable tribes and nations now it was merging together as the old linguistic and cultural divisions began to blur
although lucifer had accelerated the process it had begun decades earlier when the coming of the jet age had triggered an explosion of global tourism
at almost the same time it was not of course a coincidence satellites and fibre optics had revolutionized communications
with the historic abolition of long distance charges on 31 december 2 every telephone call became a local one and the human race greeted the new millennium by transforming itself into one huge gossiping family
like most families it was not always a peaceful one but its disputes no longer threatened the entire planet
the second and last nuclear war saw the use in combat of no more bombs than the first precisely two
and though the kilotonnage was greater the casualties were far fewer as both were used against sparsely populated oil installations
at that point the big three of china the us and the ussr moved with commendable speed and wisdom sealing off the battle zone until the surviving combatants had come to their senses
by the decade of 2 2 3 a major war between the great powers was as unthinkable as one between canada and the united states had been in the century before
this was not due to any vast improvement in human nature or indeed to any single factor except the normal preference of life over death
much of the machinery of peace was not even consciously planned before the politicians realized what had happened they discovered that it was in place and functioning well no statesman no idealist of any persuasion invented the peace hostage movement the very name was not coined until well after someone had noticed that at any given moment there were a hundred thousand russian tourists in the united states and half a million americans in the soviet union most of them engaged in their traditional pastime of complaining about the plumbing
and perhaps even more to the point both groups contained a disproportionately large number of highly non expendable individuals the sons and daughters of wealth privilege and political power
and even if one wished it was no longer possible to plan a large scale war
the age of transparency had dawned in the 199 s when enterprising news media had started to launch photographic satellites with resolutions comparable to those that the military had possessed for three decades
the pentagon and the kremlin were furious but they were no match for reuters associated press and the unsleeping twenty four hours a day cameras of the orbital news service
by 2 6 even though the world had not been completely disarmed it had been effectively pacified and the fifty remaining nuclear weapons were all under international control
there was surprisingly little opposition when that popular monarch edward viii was elected the first planetary president only a dozen states dissenting
they ranged in size and importance from the still stubbornly neutral swiss whose restaurants and hotels nevertheless greeted the new bureaucracy with open arms to the even more fanatically independent malvinians who now resisted all attempts by the exasperated british and argentines to foist them off on each other
the dismantling of the vast and wholly parasitic armaments industry had given an unprecedented sometimes indeed unhealthy boost to the world economy
no longer were vital raw materials and brilliant engineering talents swallowed up in a virtual black hole or even worse turned to destruction
instead they could be used to repair the ravages and neglect of centuries by rebuilding the world
and building new ones
now indeed mankind had found the moral equivalent of war and a challenge that could absorb the surplus energies of the race for as many millennia ahead as anyone dared to dream
4 tycoon when he was born william tsung had been called the most expensive baby in the world he held the title for only two years before it was claimed by his sister
she still held it and now that the family laws had been repealed it would never be challenged
their father the legendary sir lawrence had been born when china had re instituted the stringent one child one family rule his generation had provided psychologists and social scientists with material for endless studies
having no brothers or sisters and in many cases no uncles or aunts it was unique in human history
whether credit was due to the resilience of the species or the merit of the chinese extended family system would probably never be settled
the fact remained that the children of that strange time were remarkably free from scars but they were certainly not unaffected and sir lawrence had done his somewhat spectacular best to make up for the isolation of his infancy
when his second child was born in 22 the licensing system had become law
you could have as many children as you wished provided only that you paid the appropriate fee
the surviving old guard communists were not the only ones who thought the whole scheme perfectly appalling but they were outvoted by their pragmatic colleagues in the fledgling congress of the people s democratic republic
numbers one and two were free
number three cost a million sols
number four was two million
number five was four million and so on
the fact that in theory there were no capitalists in the people s republic was cheerfully ignored
young mr tsung that was years of course before king edward gave him his kbe never revealed if he had any target in mind he was still a fairly poor millionaire when his fifth child was born
but he was still only forty and when the purchase of hong kong did not take quite as much of his capital as he had feared he discovered that he had a considerable amount of small change in hand
so ran the legend but like many other stories about sir lawrence it was hard to distinguish fact from mythology
there was certainly no truth in the persistent rumour that he had made his first fortune through the famous shoe box sized pirate edition of the library of congress
the whole molecular memory module racket was an off earth operation made possible by the united states failure to sign the lunar treaty
even though sir lawrence was not a multitrillionaire the complex of corporations he had built up made him the greatest financial power on earth no small achievement for the son of a humble videocassette peddler in what was still known as the new territories
he probably never noticed the eight million for child number six or even the thirty two for number eight
the sixty four he had to advance on number nine attracted world publicity and after number ten the bets placed on his future plans may well have exceeded the two hundred and fifty six million the next child would have cost him
however at that point the lady jasmine who combined the best properties of steel and silk in exquisite proportion decided that the tsung dynasty was adequately established
it was quite by chance if there is such a thing that sir lawrence became personally involved in the space business
he had of course extensive maritime and aeronautical interests but these were handled by his five sons and their associates
sir lawrence s real love was communications newspapers those few that were left books magazines paper and electronic and above all the global television networks
then he had bought the magnificent old peninsular hotel which to a poor chinese boy had once seemed the very symbol of wealth and power and turned it into his residence and main office
he surrounded it by a beautiful park by the simple expedient of pushing the huge shopping centres underground his newly formed laser excavation corporation made a fortune in the process and set a precedent for many other cities
one day as he was admiring the unparalleled skyline of the city across the harbour he decided that a further improvement was necessary
the view from the lower floors of the peninsular had been blocked for decades by a large building looking like a squashed golfball
this sir lawrence decided would have to go
the director of the hong kong planetarium widely considered to be among the five best in the world had other ideas and very soon sir lawrence was delighted to discover someone he could not buy at any price
the two men became firm friends but when dr hessenstein arranged a special presentation for sir lawrence s sixtieth birthday he did not know that he would help to change the history of the solar system
5 out of the ice more than a hundred years after zeiss had built the first prototype in jena in 1924 there were still a few optical planetarium projectors in use looming dramatically over their audiences
but hong kong had retired its third generation instrument decades ago in favour of the far more versatile electronic system
the whole of the great dome was essentially a giant television screen made up of thousands of separate panels on which any conceivable image could be displayed
the programme had opened inevitably with a tribute to the unknown inventor of the rocket somewhere in china during the thirteenth century
the first five minutes were a high speed historical survey giving perhaps less than due credit to the russian german and american pioneers in order to concentrate on the career of dr hsue shen tsien
his countrymen could be excused in such a time and place if they made him appear as important in the history of rocket development as goddard von braun or koroylev
and they certainly had just grounds for indignation at his arrest on trumped up charges in the united states when after helping to establish the famed jet propulsion laboratory and being appointed caltech s first goddard professor he decided to return to his homeland
the launching of the first chinese satellite by the long march 1 rocket in 197 was barely mentioned perhaps because at that time the americans were already walking on the moon
indeed the rest of the twentieth century was dismissed in a few minutes to take the story up to 2 7 and the construction of the spaceship tsien
the narrator did not gloat unduly over the consternation of the other spacefaring powers when a presumed chinese space station suddenly blasted out of orbit and headed for jupiter to overtake the russian american mission aboard the cosmonaut alexei leonov
the story was dramatic and tragic enough to require no embellishment
unfortunately there was very little authentic visual material to illustrate it the programme had to rely largely on special effects and intelligent reconstruction from later long range photo surveys
during their brief sojourn on the icy surface of europa tsien s crew had been far too busy to make television documentaries or even set up an unattended camera
nevertheless the words spoken at the time conveyed much of the drama of that first landing on the moons of jupiter
the commentary broadcast from the approaching leonov by heywood floyd served admirably to set the scene and there were plenty of library shots of europa to illustrate it at this very moment i m looking at it through the most powerful of the ship s telescopes under this magnification it s ten times larger than the moon as you see it with the naked eye
and it s a really weird sight
the surface is a uniform pink with a few small brown patches
it s covered with an intricate network of narrow lines curling and weaving in all directions
in fact it looks very much like a photo from a medical textbook showing a pattern of veins and arteries
a few of these features are hundreds or even thousands of kilometres long and look rather like the illusory canals that percival lowell and other early twentieth century astronomers imagined they d seen on mars
but europa s canals aren t an illusion though of course they re not artificial
what s more they do contain water or at least ice
for the satellite is almost entirely covered by ocean averaging fifty kilometres deep
because it s so far from the sun europa s surface temperature is extremely low about a hundred and fifty degrees below freezing
so one might expect its single ocean to be a solid block of ice
surprisingly that isn t the case because there s a lot of heat generated inside europa by tidal forces the same forces that drive the great volcanoes on neighbouring io
so the ice is continually melting breaking up and freezing forming cracks and lanes like those in the floating ice sheets in our own polar regions
it s that intricate tracery of cracks i m seeing now most of them are dark and very ancient perhaps millions of years old
but a few are almost pure white they re the new ones that have just opened up and have a crust only a few centimetres thick
tsien has landed right beside one of these white streaks the fifteen hundred kilometre long feature that s been christened the grand canal
presumably the chinese intend to pump its water into their propellant tanks so that they can explore the jovian satellite system and then return to earth
that may not be easy but they ll certainly have studied the landing site with great care and must know what they re doing
it s obvious now why they ve taken such a risk and why they claim europa
as a refuelling point it could be the key to the entire solar system but it hadn t worked out that way thought sir lawrence as he reclined in his luxurious chair beneath the streaked and mottled disc that filled his artificial sky
the oceans of europa were still inaccessible to mankind for reasons which were still a mystery
and not only inaccessible but invisible since jupiter had become a sun both its inner satellites had vanished beneath clouds of vapour boiling out from their interiors
he was looking at europa as it had been back in 2 1 not as it was today
he had been little more than a boy then but could still remember the pride he felt in knowing that his countrymen however much he disapproved of their politics were about to make the first landing on a virgin world
there had been no camera there of course to record that landing but the reconstruction was superbly done
he could really believe that was the doomed spaceship dropping silently out of the jetblack sky towards the europan icescape and coming to rest beside the discoloured band of recently frozen water that had been christened the grand canal
everyone knew what had happened next perhaps wisely there had been no attempt to reproduce it visually
instead the image of europa faded to be replaced by a portrait as familiar to every chinese as yuri gagarin s was to every russian
the first photograph showed rupert chang on his graduation day in 1989 the earnest young scholar indistinguishable from a million others utter1y unaware of his appointment with history two decades in the future
briefly to a background of subdued music the commentator summed up the highlights of dr chang s career until his appointment as science officer aboard tsien
cross sections in time the photographs grew older until the last one taken immediately before the mission
sir lawrence was glad of the planetarium s darkness both his friends and his enemies would have been surprised to see the moisture gathering in his eyes as he listened to the message that dr chang had aimed towards the approaching leonov never knowing if it would be received
know you are aboard leonov may not have much time aiming my suit antenna where i think the signal vanished for agonizing seconds then came back much clearer though not appreciably louder
relay this information to earth
tsien destroyed three hours ago
i m only survivor
using my suit radio no idea if it has enough range but it s the only chance
please listen carefully
there is life on europa
i repeat there is life on europa
the signal faded again
soon after local midnight
we were pumping steadily and the tanks were almost half full
dr lee and i went out to check the pipe insulation
tsien stands stood about thirty metres from the edge of the grand canal
pipes go directly from it and down through the ice
very thin not safe to walk on
the warm upwelling again a long silence
no problem five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship
like a christmas tree beautiful shining right through the ice
glorious colours
lee saw it first a huge dark mass rising up from the depths
at first we thought it was a school of fish too large for a single organism then it started to break through the ice
like huge strands of wet seaweed crawling along the ground
lee ran back to the ship to get a camera i stayed to watch reporting over the radio
the thing moved so slowly i could easily outrun it
i was much more excited than alarmed
thought i knew what kind of creature it was i ve seen pictures of the kelp forests off california but i was quite wrong
i could tell it was in trouble
it couldn t possibly survive at a temperature a hundred and fifty below its normal environment
it was freezing solid as it moved forward bits were breaking off like glass but it was still advancing towards the ship a black tidal wave slowing down all the time
i was still so surprised that i couldn t think straight and i couldn t imagine what it was trying to do
climbing up the ship building a kind of ice tunnel as it advanced
perhaps this was insulating it from the cold the way termites protect themselves from sunlight with their little corridors of mud
tons of ice on the ship
the radio antennas broke off first
then i could see the landing legs beginning to buckle all in slow motion like a dream
not until the ship started to topple did i realize what the thing was trying to do and then it was too late
we could have saved ourselves if we d only switched off those lights
perhaps it s a phototrope its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight that filters through the ice
or it could have been attracted like a moth to a candle
our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that europa has ever known
then the ship crashed
i saw the hull split a cloud of snowflakes form as moisture condensed
all the lights went out except for one swinging back and forth on a cable a couple of metres above the ground
i don t know what happened immediately after that
the next thing i remember i was standing under the light beside the wreck of the ship with a fine powdering of fresh snow all around me
i could see my footsteps in it very clearly
i must have run there perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed the plant i still thought of it as a plant was motionless
i wondered if it had been damaged by the impact large sections as thick as a man s arm had splintered off like broken twigs
then the main trunk started to move again
it pulled away from the hull and began to crawl towards me
that was when i knew for certain that the thing was light sensitive i was standing immediately under the thousand watt lamp which had stopped swinging now
imagine an oak tree better still a banyan with its multiple trunks and roots flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground
it got to within five metres of the light then started to spread out until it had made a perfect circle around me
presumably that was the limit of its tolerance the point at which photo attraction turned to repulsion
after that nothing happened for several minutes
i wondered if it was dead frozen solid at last
then i saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches
it was like watching a time lapse film of flowers opening
in fact i thought they were flowers each about as big as a man s head
delicate beautifully coloured membranes started to unfold
even then it occurred to me that no one no thing could ever have seen these colours before they had no existence until we brought our lights our fatal lights to this world
tendrils stamens waving feebly
i walked over to the living wall that surrounded me so that i would see exactly what was happening
neither then or at any other time had i felt the slightest fear of the creature
i was certain that it was not malevolent if indeed it was conscious at all
there were scores of the big flowers in various stages of unfolding
now they reminded me of butterflies just emerging from the chrysalis wings crumpled still feeble
i was getting closer and closer to the truth
but they were freezing dying as quickly as they formed
then one after another they dropped off from the parent buds
for a few moments they flopped around like fish stranded on dry land and at last i realized exactly what they were
those membranes weren t petals they were fins or their equivalent
this was the free swimming larval stage of the creature
probably it spends much of its life rooted on the seabed then sends these mobile offspring in search of new territory
just like the corals of earth s oceans
i knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures
the beautiful colours were fading now to a drab brown
some of the petal fins had snapped off becoming brittle shards as they froze
but it was still moving feebly and as i approached it tried to avoid me
i wondered how it sensed my presence
then i noticed that the stamens as i d called them all carried bright blue dots at their tips
they looked like tiny star sapphires or the blue eyes along the mantle of a scallop aware of light but unable to form true images
as i watched the vivid blue faded the sapphires became dull ordinary stones dr floyd or anyone else who is listening i haven t much more time jupiter will soon block my signal
but i ve almost finished
i knew then what i had to do
the cable to that thousand watt lamp was hanging almost to the ground
i gave it a few tugs and the light went out in a shower of sparks
i wondered if it was too late
for a few minutes nothing happened
so i walked over to the wall of tangled branches around me and kicked it
slowly the creature started to unweave itself and to retreat back to the canal
there was plenty of light i could see everything perfectly
ganymede and callisto were in the sky jupiter was a huge thin crescent and there was a big auroral display on the nightside at the jovian end of the io flux tube
there was no need to use my helmet light
i followed the creature all the way back to the water encouraging it with more kicks when it slowed down feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the time beneath my boots as it neared the canal it seemed to gain strength and energy as if it knew that it was approaching its natural home
i wondered if it would survive to bud again
it disappeared through the surface leaving a few last dead larvae on the alien land
the exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab of protective ice sealed it from the vacuum above
then i walked back to the ship to see if there was anything to salvage i don t want to talk about that i ve only two requests to make doctor
when the taxonomists classify this creature i hope they ll name it after me
and when the next ship comes home ask them to take our bones back to china jupiter will be cutting us off in a few minutes
i wish i knew whether anyone was receiving me
anyway i ll repeat this message when we re in line of sight again if my suit s life support system lasts that long
this is professor chang on europa reporting the destruction of spaceship tsien
we landed beside the grand canal and set up our pumps at the edge of the ice the signal faded abruptly came back for a moment then disappeared completely below the noise level
there would never be any further message from professor chang but it had already deflected lawrence tsung s ambitions into space
6 the greening of ganymede rolf van der berg was the right man in the right place at the right time no other combination would have worked
which of course is how much of history is made
he was the right man because he was a second generation afrikaner refugee and a trained geologist both factors were equally important
he was in the right place because that had to be the largest of the jovian moons third outwards in the sequence io europa ganymede callisto
the time was not so critical for the information had been ticking away like a delayed action bomb in the data banks for at least a decade
van der berg did not encounter it until 57 even then it took him another year to convince himself that he was not crazy and it was 59 before he had quietly sequestered the original records so that no one could duplicate his discovery
only then could he safely give his full attention to the main problem what to do next
it had all begun as is so often the case with an apparently trivial observation in a field which did not even concern van der berg directly
his job as a member of the planetary engineering task force was to survey and catalogue the natural resources of ganymede he had little business fooling around with the forbidden satellite next door
but europa was an enigma which no one least of all its immediate neighbours could ignore for long
every seven days it passed between ganymede and the brilliant minisun that had once been jupiter producing eclipses which could last as long as twelve minutes
at its closest it appeared slightly smaller than the moon as seen from earth but it dwindled to a mere quarter of that size when it was on the other side of its orbit
the eclipses were often spectacular
just before it slid between ganymede and lucifer europa would become an ominous black disc outlined with a ring of crimson fire as the light of the new sun was refracted through the atmosphere it had helped to create
in less than half a human lifetime europa had been transformed
the crust of ice on the hemisphere always facing lucifer had melted to form the solar system s second ocean
for a decade it had foamed and bubbled into the vacuum above it until equilibrium had been reached
now europa possessed a thin but serviceable though not to human beings atmosphere of water vapour hydrogen sulphide carbon and sulphur dioxides nitrogen and miscellaneous rare gases
though the somewhat misnamed nightside of the satellite was still permanently frozen an area as large as africa now had a temperate climate liquid water and a few scattered islands
all this and not much more had been observed through telescopes in earth orbit
by the time that the first full scale expedition had been launched to the galilean moons in 2 28 europa had already become veiled by a permanent mantle of clouds
cautious radar probing revealed little but smooth ocean on one face and almost equally smooth ice on the other europa still maintained its reputation as the flattest piece of real estate in the solar system
ten years later that was no longer true something drastic had happened to europa
it now possessed a solitary mountain almost as high as everest jutting up through the ice of the twilight zone
presumably some volcanic activity like that occurring ceaselessly on neighbouring io had thrust this mass of material skywards
the vastly increased heat flow from lucifer could have triggered such an event
but there were problems with this obvious explanation
mount zeus was an irregular pyramid not the usual volcanic cone and radar scans showed none of the characteristic lava flows
some poor quality photographs obtained through telescopes on ganymede during a momentary break in the clouds suggested that it was made of ice like the frozen landscape around it
whatever the answer the creation of mount zeus had been a traumatic experience for the world it dominated for the entire crazy paving pattern of fractured ice floes over the nightside had changed completely
one maverick scientist had put forward the theory that mount zeus was a cosmic iceberg a cometary fragment that had dropped upon europa from space battered callisto gave ample proof that such bombardments had occurred in the remote past
the theory was very unpopular on ganymede whose would be colonists already had sufficient problems
they had been much relieved when van der berg had refuted the theory convincingly any mass of ice this size would have shattered on impact and even if it hadn t europa s gravity modest though it was would have quickly brought about its collapse
radar measurements showed that though mount zeus was indeed steadily sinking its overall shape remained completely unaltered
ice was not the answer
the problem could of course have been settled by sending a single probe through the clouds of europa
unfortunately whatever was beneath that almost permanent overcast did not encourage curiosity
all these worlds are yours except europa
attempt no landings there
that last message relayed from the spaceship discovery just before its destruction had not been forgotten but there had been endless arguments about its interpretation
did landings refer to robot probes or only to manned vehicles
and what about close flybys manned or unmanned
or balloons floating in the upper atmosphere
the scientists were anxious to find out but the general public was distinctly nervous
any power that could detonate the mightiest planet in the solar system was not to be trifled with
and it would take centuries to explore and exploit io ganymede callisto and the dozens of minor satellites europa could wait
more than once therefore van der berg had been told not to waste his valuable time on research of no practical importance when there was so much to be done on ganymede
where can we find carbon phosphorus nitrates for the hydroponic farms
how stable is the barnard escarpment
is there any danger of more mudslides in phrygia
and so on and so forth but he had inherited his boer ancestors well deserved reputation for stubbornness even when he was working on his numerous other projects he kept looking over his shoulder at europa
and one day just a few hours a gale from the nightside cleared the skies about mount zeus
7 transit i too take leave of all 1 ever had from what depths of memory had that line come swimming up to the surface
heywood floyd closed his eyes and tried to focus on the past
it was certainly from a poem and he had hardly read a line of poetry since leaving college
and little enough then except during a short english appreciation seminar
with no further clues it might take the station computer quite a while perhaps as much as ten minutes to locate the line in the whole body of english literature
but that would be cheating not to mention expensive and floyd preferred to accept the intellectual challenge
a war poem of course but which war
there had been so many in the twentieth century
he was still searching through the mental mists when his guests arrived moving with the effortless slow motion grace of longtime one sixth gravity residents
the society of pasteur was strongly influenced by what had been christened centrifugal stratification some people never left the zero gee of the hub while those who hoped one day to return to earth preferred the almost normal weight regime out on the rim of the huge slowly revolving disc
george and jerry were now floyd s oldest and closest friends which was surprising because they had so few obvious points in common
looking back on his own somewhat chequered emotional career two marriages three formal contracts two informal ones three children he often envied the long term stability of their relationship apparently quite unaffected by the nephews from earth or moon who visited them from time to time
haven t you ever thought of divorce
he had once asked them teasingly
as usual george whose acrobatic yet profoundly serious conducting had been largely responsible for the comeback of the classical orchestra was at no loss for words
divorce never was his swift reply
murder often
of course he d never get away with it jerry had retorted
sebastian would spill the beans
sebastian was a beautiful and talkative parrot which the couple had imported after a long battle with the hospital authorities
he could not only talk but could reproduce the opening bars of the sibelius violin concerto with which jerry considerably helped by antonio stradivari had made his reputation half a century ago
now the time had come to say goodbye to george jerry and sebastian perhaps only for a few weeks perhaps for ever
floyd had already made all his other farewells in a round of parties that had gravely depleted the station s wine cellar and could think of nothing he had left undone
archie his early model but still perfectly serviceable comsec had been programmed to handle all incoming messages either by sending out appropriate replies or by routing anything urgent and personal to him aboard universe
it would be strange after all these years not to be able to talk to anyone he wished though in compensation he could also avoid unwanted callers
after a few days into the voyage the ship would be far enough from earth to make real time conversation impossible and all communication would have to be by recorded voice or teletext
we thought you were our friend complained george
it was a dirty trick to make us your executors especially as you re not going to leave us anything
you may have a few surprises grinned floyd
anyway archie will take care of all the details
i d just like you to monitor my mail in case there s anything he doesn t understand
if he won t nor will we
what do we know about all your scientific societies and that sort of nonsense
they can look after themselves
please see that the cleaning staff doesn t mess things up too badly while i m away and if i don t come back here are a few personal items i d like delivered mostly family
family
there were pains as well as pleasures in living as long as he had done
it had been sixty three sixty three
years since marion had died in that air crash
now he felt a twinge of guilt because he could not even recall the grief he must have known
or at best it was a synthetic reconstruction not a genuine memory
what would they have meant to each other had she still been alive
she would have been just a hundred years old by now
and now the two little girls he had once loved so much were friendly grey haired strangers in their late sixties with children and grandchildren
of their own
at last count there had been nine on that side of the family without archie s help he would never be able to keep track of their names
but at least they all remembered him at christmas through duty if not affection
his second marriage of course had overlain the memories of his first like the later writing on a medieval palimpsest
that too had ended fifty years ago somewhere between earth and jupiter
though he had hoped for a reconciliation with both wife and son there had been time for only one brief meeting among all the welcoming ceremonies before his accident exiled him to pasteur
the meeting had not been a success nor had the second arranged at considerable expense and difficulty aboard the space hospital itself indeed in this very room
chris had been twenty then and had just married if there was one thing that united floyd and caroline it was disapproval of his choice
yet helena had turned out remarkably well she had been a good mother to chris ii born barely a month after the marriage
and when like so many other young wives she was widowed by the copernicus disaster she did not lose her head
there was a curious irony in the fact that both chris i and ii had lost their fathers to space though in very different ways
floyd had returned briefly to his eight year old son as a total stranger chris ii had at least known a father for the first decade of his life before losing him for ever
and where was chris these days
neither caroline nor helena who were now the best of friends seemed to know whether he was on earth or in space
but that was typical only postcards date stamped clavius base had informed his family of his first visit to the moon
floyd s card was still taped prominently above his desk
chris ii had a good sense of humour and of history
he had mailed his grandfather that famous photograph of the monolith looming over the spacesuited figures gathered round it in the tycho excavation more than half a century ago
all the others in the group were now dead and the monolith itself was no longer on the moon
in 2 6 after much controversy it had been brought to earth and erected an uncanny echo of the main building in the united nations plaza
it had been intended to remind the human race that it was no longer alone five years later with lucifer blazing in the sky no such reminder was needed
floyd s fingers were not very steady sometimes his right hand seemed to have a will of its own as he unpeeled the card and slipped it into his pocket
it would be almost the only personal possession he would take when he boarded universe
twenty five days you ll be back before we ve noticed you re gone said jerry
and by the way is it true that you ll have dimitri onboard
that little cossack
snorted george
i conducted his second symphony back in 22
wasn t that when the first violin threw up during the largo
no that was mahler not mihailovich
and anyway it was the brass so nobody noticed except the unlucky tuba player who sold his instrument the next day
you re making this up
of course
but give the old rascal my love and ask him if he remembers that night we had out in vienna
who else have you got aboard
i ve heard horrible rumours about press gangs said jerry thoughtful1y
greatly exaggerated i can assure you
we ve all been personally chosen by sir lawrence for our intelligence wit beauty charisma or other redeeming virtue
not expendability
well now that you mention it we ve all had to sign a depressing legal document absolving tsung spacelines from every conceivable liability
my copy s in that file by the way
any chance of us collecting on it
asked george hopefully
no my lawyers say it s iron clad
tsung agrees to take me to halley and back give me food water air and a room with a view
and in return
when i get back i ll do my best to promote future voyages make some video appearances write a few articles all very reasonable for the chance of a lifetime
oh yes i ll also entertain my fellow passengers and vice versa
how
song and dance
well i hope to inflict selected portions of my memoirs on a captive audience
but i don t think i ll be able to compete with the professionals
did you know that yva merlin will be on board
what
how did they coax her out of that park avenue cell
she must be a hundred and oops sorry hey
she s seventy plus or minus five
forget the minus
i was just a kid when napoleon came out
there was a long pause while each of the trio scanned his memories of that famous work
although some critics considered her scarlett o hara to be her finest role to the general public yva merlin n e evelyn miles when she was born in cardiff south wales was still identified with josephine
almost half a century ago david griffin s controversial epic had delighted the french and infuriated the british though both sides now agreed that he had occasionally allowed his artistic impulses to trifle with the historical record notably in the spectacular final sequence of the emperor s coronation in westminster abbey
that s quite a scoop for sir lawrence said george thoughtfully
i think i can claim some credit for that
her father was an astronomer he worked for me at one time and she s always been quite interested in science
so i made a few video calls
heywood floyd did not feel it necessary to add that like a substantial fraction of the human race he had fallen in love with yva ever since the appearance of gwtw mark ii
of course he continued sir lawrence was delighted but i had to convince him that she had more than a casual interest in astronomy
otherwise the voyage could be a social disaster
which reminds me said george producing a small package he had been not very successfully hiding behind his back
we have a little present for you
can i open it now
do you think he should
jerry wondered anxiously
in that case i certainly will said floyd untying the bright green ribbon and unwrapping the paper
inside was a nicely framed painting
although floyd knew little of art he had seen it before indeed who could ever forget it
the makeshift raft tossing on the waves was crowded with half naked castaways some already moribund others waving desperately at a ship on the horizon
beneath it was the caption the raft of the medusa theodore g ricault 1791 1824 and underneath that was the message signed by george and jerry getting there is half the fun
you re a pair of bastards and i love you dearly said floyd embracing them both
the attention light on archie s keyboard was flashing briskly it was time to go
his friends left in a silence more eloquent than words
for the last time heywood floyd looked around the little room that had been his universe for almost half his life
and suddenly he remembered how that poem ended i have been happy happy now i go
8 starfleet sir lawrence tsung was not a sentimental man and was far too cosmopolitan to take patriotism seriously though as an undergraduate he had briefly sported one of the artificial pigtails worn during the third cultural revolution
yet the planetarium re enactment of the tsien disaster moved him deeply and caused him to focus much of his enormous influence and energy upon space
before long he was taking weekend trips to the moon and had appointed his son charles the thirty two million so
one as vice president of tsung astrofreight
the new corporation had only two catapult launched hydrogen fuelled ramrockets of less than a thousand tons empty mass they would soon be obsolete but they could provide charles with the experience that sir lawrence was quite certain would be needed in the decades ahead
for at long last the space age was truly about to begin
little more than half a century had separated the wright brothers and the coming of cheap mass air transportation it had taken twice as long to meet the far greater challenge of the solar system
yet when luis alvarez and his team had discovered muon catalysed fusion back in the 195 s it had seemed no more than a tantalizing laboratory curiosity of only theoretical interest
just as the great lord rutherford had pooh poohed the prospects of atomic power so alvarez himself doubted that cold nuclear fusion would ever be of practical importance
indeed it was not until 2 4 that the unexpected and accidental manufacture of stable muonium hydrogen compounds had opened up a new chapter of human history exactly as the discovery of the neutron had initiated the atomic age
now small portable nuclear power plants could be built with a minimum of shielding
such enormous investments had already been made in conventional fusion that the world s electrical utilities were not at first affected but the impact on space travel was immediate it could be paralleled only by the jet revolution in air transport of a hundred years earlier
no longer energy limited spacecraft could achieve far greater speeds flight times in the solar system could now be measured in weeks rather than months or even years
but the muon drive was still a reaction device a sophisticated rocket no different in principle from its chemically fuelled ancestors it needed a working fluid to give it thrust
and the cheapest cleanest and most convenient of all working fluids was plain water
the pacific spaceport was not likely to run short of this useful substance
matters were different at the next port of call the moon
not a trace of water had been discovered by the surveyor apollo and luna missions
if the moon had ever possessed any native water aeons of meteoric bombardment had boiled and blasted it into space
or so the selenologists believed yet clues to the contrary had been visible ever since galileo had turned his first telescope upon the moon
some lunar mountains for a few hours after dawn glitter as brilliantly as if they are capped with snow
the most famous case is the rim of the magnificent crater aristarchus which william herschel the father of modem astronomy once observed shining so brightly in the lunar night that he decided it must be an active volcano
he was wrong what he saw was the earthlight reflected from a thin and transient layer of frost condensed during the three hundred hours of freezing darkness
the discovery of the great ice deposits beneath schroter s valley the sinuous canyon winding away from anstarchus was the last factor in the equation that would transform the economics of space flight
the moon could provide a filling station just where it was needed high up on the outermost slopes of the earth s gravitational field at the beginning of the long haul to the planets
cosmos first of the tsung fleet had been designed to carry freight and passengers on the earth moon mars run and as a test vehicle through complex deals with a dozen organizations and governments of the still experimental muon drive
built at the imbriurn shipyards she had just sufficient thrust to lift off from the moon with zero payload operating from orbit to orbit she would never again touch the surface of any world
with his usual flair for publicity sir lawrence arranged for her maiden flight to commence on the hundredth anniversary of sputnik day 4 october 2 57
two years later cosmos was joined by a sister ship
galaxy was designed for the earth jupiter run and had enough thrust to operate directly to any of the jovian moons though at considerable sacrifice of payload
if necessary she could even return to her lunar berth for refitting
she was by far the swiftest vehicle ever built by man if she burned up her entire propellant mass in one orgasm of acceleration she would attain a speed of a thousand kilometres a second which would take her from earth to jupiter in a week and to the nearest star in not much more than ten thousand years
the third ship of the fleet and sir lawrence s pride and joy embodied all that had been learned in the building of her two sisters
but universe was not intended primarily for freight
she was designed from the beginning as the first passenger liner to cruise the space lanes right out to saturn the jewel of the solar system
sir lawrence had planned something even more spectacular for her maiden voyage but construction delays caused by a dispute with the lunar chapter of the reformed teamsters union had upset his schedule
there would just be time for the initial flight tests and lloyd s certification in the closing months of 2 6 before universe left earth orbit for her rendezvous
it would be a very close thing halley s comet would not wait even for sir lawrence tsung
9 mount zeus the survey satellite europa vi had been in orbit for almost fifteen years and had far exceeded its design life whether it should be replaced was a subject of considerable debate in the small ganymede scientific establishment
it carried the usual collection of data gathering instruments as well as a now virtually useless imaging system
though still in perfect working order all that this normally showed of europa was an unbroken cloudscape
the overworked science team on ganymede scanned the recordings in quick look mode once a week then squirted the raw data back to earth
on the whole they would be rather relieved when europa vi expired and its torrent of uninteresting gigabytes finally dried up
now for the first time in years it had produced something exciting
orbit 71934 said the deputy chief astronomer who had called van der berg as soon as the latest data dump had been evaluated
coming in from the nightside heading straight for mount zeus
you won t see anything for another ten seconds though
the screen was completely black yet van der berg could imagine the frozen landscape rolling past beneath its blanket of clouds a thousand kilometres below
in a few hours the distant sun would be shining there for europa revolved on its axis once in every seven earth days
nightside should really be called twilight side for half the time it had ample light but no heat
yet the inaccurate name had stuck because it had emotional validity europa knew sunrise but never lucifer rise
and the sunrise was coming now speeded up a thousandfold by the racing probe
a faintly luminous band bisected the screen as the horizon emerged from darkness
the explosion of light was so sudden that van der berg could almost imagine he was looking into the glare of an atomic bomb
in a fraction of a second it ran through all the colours of the rainbow then became pure white as the sun leapt above the mountain then vanished as the automatic filters cut into the circuit
that s all pity there was no operator on duty at the time he could have panned the camera down and had a good view of the mountain as we went over
but i knew you d like to see it even though it disproves your theory
how
said van der berg more puzzled than annoyed
when you go through it in slow motion you ll see what i mean
those beautiful rainbow effects they re not atmospheric they re caused by the mountain itself
only ice could do that
or glass which doesn t seem very likely
not impossible volcanoes can produce natural glass but it s usually black of course
yes
er i won t commit myself until i ve been through the data
but my guess would be rock crystal transparent quartz
you can make beautiful prisms and lenses out of it
any chance of some more observations
i m afraid not that was pure luck sun mountain camera all lined up at the right time
it won t happen again in a thousand years
thanks anyway can you send me over a copy
no hurry i m just leaving on a field trip to perrine and won t be able to look at it until i get back
van der berg gave a short rather apologetic laugh
you know if that really is rock crystal it would be worth a fortune
might even help solve our balance of payments problem but that of course was utter fantasy
whatever wonders or treasures europa might conceal the human race had been forbidden access to them by that last message from discovery
fifty years later there was no sign that the interdiction would ever be lifted
1 ship of fools for the first forty eight hours of the voyage heywood floyd could not really believe the comfort the spaciousness the sheer extravagance of universe s living arrangements
yet most of his fellow passengers took them for granted those who had never left earth before assumed that all spaceships must be like this
he had to look back at the history of aeronautics to put matters in the right perspective
in his own lifetime he had witnessed indeed experienced the revolution that had occurred in the skies of the planet now dwindling behind him
between the clumsy old leonov and the sophisticated universe lay exactly fifty years
emotionally he couldn t really believe that but it was useless arguing about arithmetic
and just fifty years had separated the wright brothers from the first jet airliners
at the beginning of that half century intrepid aviators had hopped from field to field begoggled and windswept on open chairs at its end grandmothers had slumbered peacefully between continents at a thousand kilometres an hour
so he should not perhaps have been astonished at the luxury and elegant decor of his stateroom or even the fact that he had a steward to keep it tidy
the generously sized window was the most startling feature of his suite and at first he felt quite uncomfortable thinking of the tons of air pressure it was holding in check against the implacable and never for a moment relaxing vacuum of space
the biggest surprise even though the advance literature should have prepared him for it was the presence of gravity
universe was the first spaceship ever built to cruise under continuous acceleration except for the few hours of the mid course turnaround
when her huge propellant tanks were fully loaded with their five thousand tons of water she could manage a tenth of a gee not much but enough to keep loose objects from drifting around
this was particularly convenient at mealtimes though it took a few days for the passengers to learn not to stir their soup too vigorously
forty eight hours out from earth the population of universe had already stratified itself into four distinct classes
the aristocracy consisted of captain smith and his officers
next came the passengers then crew non commissioned and stewards
and then steerage that was the description that the five young space scientists had adopted for themselves first as a joke but later with a certain amount of bitterness
when hoyd compared their cramped and jury rigged quarters with his own luxurious cabin he could see their point of view and soon became the conduit of their complaints to the captain
yet all things considered they had little to grumble about in the rush to get the ship ready it had been touch and go as to whether there would be any accommodation for them and their equipment
now they could look forward to deploying instruments around and on the comet during the critical days before it rounded the sun and departed once more to the outer reaches of the solar system
the members of the science team would establish their reputations on this voyage and knew it
only in moments of exhaustion or fury with misbehaving instrumentation did they start complaining about the noisy ventilating system the claustrophobic cabins and occasional strange smells of unknown origin
but never the food which everyone agreed was excellent
much better captain smith assured them than darwin had on the beagle
to which victor willis had promptly retorted how does he know
and by the way beagle s commander cut his throat when he got back to england
that was rather typical of victor perhaps the planet s best known science communicator to his fans or pop scientist to his equally numerous detractors
it would be unfair to call them enemies admiration for his talents was universal if occasionally grudging
his soft mid pacific accent and expansive gestures on camera were widely parodied and he had been credited or blamed for the revival of full length beards
a man who grows that much hair critics were fond of saying must have a lot to hide
he was certainly the most instantly recognizable of the six vips though floyd who no longer regarded himself as a celebrity always referred to them ironically as the famous five
yva merlin could often walk unrecognized on park avenue on the rare occasions when she emerged from her apartment
dimitri mihailovich to his considerable annoyance was a good ten centimetres below average height this might help to explain his fondness for thousand piece orchestras real or synthesized but did not enhance his public image
clifford greenburg and margaret m bala also fell into the category of famous unknowns though this would certainly change when they got back to earth
the first man to land on mercury had one of those pleasant unremarkable faces that are very hard to remember moreover the days when he had dominated the news were now thirty years in the past
and like most authors who are not addicted to talk shows and autographing sessions ms m bala would be unrecognized by the vast majority of her millions of readers
her literary fame had been one of the sensations of the forties
a scholarly study of the greek pantheon was not usually a candidate for the best seller lists but ms m bala had placed its eternally inexhaustible myths in a contemporary space age setting
names which a century earlier had been familiar only to astronomers and classical scholars were now part of every educated person s world picture almost every day there would be news from ganymede callisto io titan japetus or even more obscure worlds like carme pasipha hyperion phoebe
her book would have been no more than modestly successful however had she not focused on the complicated family life of jupiter zeus father of all the gods as well as much else
and by a stroke of luck an editor of genius had changed her original title the view from olympus to the passions of the gods
envious academics usually referred to it as olympic lusts but invariably wished they had written it
not surprisingly it was maggie m as she was quickly christened by her fellow passengers who first used the phrase ship of fools
victor willis adopted it eagerly and soon discovered an intriguing historical resonance
almost a century ago katherine anne porter had herself sailed with a group of scientists and writers aboard an ocean liner to watch the launch of apollo 17 and the end of the first phase of lunar exploration
i ll think about it ms m bala had remarked ominously when this was reported to her
perhaps it s time for a third version
but i won t know of course until we get back to earth 11 the lie it was many months before rolf van der berg could once again turn his thoughts and energies towards mount zeus
the taming of ganymede was a more than full time job and he was away from his main office at dardanus base for weeks at a time surveying the route of the proposed gilgamesh osiris monorail
the geography of the third and largest galilean moon had changed drastically since the detonation of jupiter and it was still changing
the new sun that had melted the ice of europa was not as powerful here four hundred thousand kilometres further out but it was warm enough to produce a temperate climate at the centre of the face forever turned towards it
there were small shallow seas some as large as earth s mediterranean up to latitudes forty north and south
not many features still survived from the maps generated by the voyager missions back in the twentieth century
melting permafrost and occasional tectonic movements triggered by the same tidal forces operating on the two inner moons made the new ganymede a cartographer s nightmare
but those very factors also made it a planetary engineer s paradise
here was the only world except for the arid and much less hospitable mars on which men might one day walk unprotected beneath an open sky
ganymede had ample water all the chemicals of life and at least while lucifer shone a warmer climate than much of earth
best of all full body spacesuits were no longer necessary the atmosphere though still unbreathable was just dense enough to permit the use of simple face masks and oxygen cylinders
in a few decades so the microbiologists promised though they were hazy about specific dates even these could be discarded
strains of oxygen generating bacteria had already been let loose across the face of ganymede most had died but some had flourished and the slowly rising curve on the atmospheric analysis chart was the first exhibit proudly displayed to all visitors at dardanus
for a long time van der berg kept a watchful eye on the data flowing in from europa vi hoping that one day the clouds would clear again when it was orbiting above mount zeus
he knew that the odds were against it but while the slightest chance existed he made no effort to explore any other avenue of research
there was no hurry he had far more important work on his hands and anyway the explanation might turn out to be something quite trivial and uninteresting
then europa vi suddenly expired almost certainly as a result of a random meteoric impact
back on earth victor willis had made rather a fool of himself in the opinion of many by interviewing the euronuts who now more than adequately filled the gap left by the ufo enthusiasts of the previous century
some of them argued that the probe s demise was due to hostile action from the world below the fact that it had been allowed to operate without interference for fifteen years almost twice its design life did not bother them in the least
to victor s credit he stressed this point and demolished most of the cultists other arguments but the consensus was that he should never have given them publicity in the first place
to van der berg who quite relished his colleagues description of him as a stubborn dutchman and did his best to live up to it the failure of europa vi was a challenge not to be resisted
there was not the slightest hope of funding a replacement for the silencing of the garrulous and embarrassingly long lived probe had been received with considerable relief
so what was the alternative
van der berg sat down to consider his options
because he was a geologist and not an astrophysicist it was several days before he suddenly realized that the answer had been staring him in the face ever since he had landed on ganymede
afrikaans is one of the world s best languages in which to curse even when spoken politely it can bruise innocent bystanders
van der berg let off steam for a few minutes then he put through a call to the tiamat observatory sitting precisely on the equator with the tiny blinding disc of lucifer forever vertically overhead
astrophysicists concerned with the most spectacular objects in the universe tend to patronize mere geologists who devote their lives to small messy things like planets
but out here on the frontier everyone helped everyone else and dr wilkins was not only interested but sympathetic
the tiamat observatory had been built for a single purpose which had indeed been one of the main reasons for establishing a base on ganymede
the study of lucifer was of enormous importance not only to pure scientists but also to nuclear engineers meteorologists oceanographers and not least to statesmen and philosophers
that there were entities which could turn a planet into a sun was a staggering thought and had kept many awake at night
it would be well for mankind to learn all it could about the process one day there might be need to imitate it or prevent it
and so for more than a decade tiamat had been observing lucifer with every possible type of instrumentation continually recording its spectrum across the entire electromagnetic band and also actively probing it with radar from a modest hundred metre dish slung across a small impact crater
yes said dr wilkins we ve often looked at europa and io
but our beam is fixed on lucifer so we can only see them for a few minutes while they re in transit
and your mount zeus is just on the dayside so it s hidden from us then
i realize that said van der berg a little impatiently
but couldn t you offset the beam by just a little so you could have a look at europa before it comes in line
ten or twenty degrees would get you far enough into dayside
one degree would be enough to miss lucifer and get europa full face on the other side of its orbit
but then it would be more than three times further away so we d only have a hundredth of the reflected power
might work though we ll give it a try
let me have the specs on frequencies wave envelopes polarization and anything else your remote sensing people think will help
it won t take us long to rig up a phase shifting network that will slew the beam a couple of degrees
more than that i don t know it s not a problem we ve ever considered
though perhaps we should have done so anyway what do you expect to find on europa except ice and water
if i knew said van der berg cheerfully i wouldn t be asking for help would i
and i wouldn t be asking for full credit when you publish
too bad my name s at the end of the alphabet you ll be ahead of me by only one letter
that was a year ago the long range scans hadn t been good enough and offsetting the beam to look on to europa s dayside just before conjunction had proved more difficult than expected
but at last the results were in the computers had digested them and van der berg was the first human being to look at a mineralogical map of post lucifer europa
it was as dr wilkins had surmised mostly ice and water with outcroppings of basalt interspersed with deposits of sulphur
but there were two anomalies
one appeared to be an artefact of the imaging process there was an absolutely straight feature two kilometres long which showed virtually no radar echo
van der berg left dr wilkins to puzzle over that he was only concerned with mount zeus
it had taken him a long time to make the identification because only a madman or a really desperate scientist would have dreamed that such a thing was possible
even now though every parameter checked to the limits of accuracy he still could not really believe it
and he had not even attempted to consider his next move
when dr wilkins called anxious to see his name and reputation spreading through the data banks he mumbled that he was still analysing the results
but at last he could put it off no longer
nothing very exciting he told his unsuspecting colleague
merely a rare form of quartz i m still trying to match it from earth samples
it was the first time he had ever lied to a fellow scientist and he felt terrible about it
but what was the alternative
12 oom paul rolf van der berg had not seen his uncle paul for a decade and it was not likely that they would ever again meet in the flesh
yet he felt very close to the old scientist the last of his generation and the only one who could recall when he wished which was seldom his forefathers way of life
dr paul kreuger oom paul to all his family and most of his friends was always there when he was needed with information and advice either in person or at the end of a half billion kilometre radio link
rumour had it that only extreme political pressure had forced the nobel committee with great reluctance to overlook his contributions to particle physics now once more in desperate disarray after the general house cleaning at the end of the twentieth century
if this was true dr kreuger bore no grudge
modest and unassuming he had no personal enemies even among the cantankerous factions of his fellow exiles
indeed he was so universally respected that he had received several invitations to re visit the united states of southern africa but had always politely declined not he hastened to explain because he felt he would be in any physical danger in the ussa but because he feared that the sense of nostalgia would be overwhelming
even using the security of a language now understood by less than a million people van der berg had been very discreet and had used circumlocutions and references that would be meaningless except to a close relative
but paul had no difficulty in understanding his nephew s message though he could not take it seriously
he was afraid young rolf had made a fool of himself and would let him down as gently as possible
just as well he hadn t rushed to publish at least he had the sense to keep quiet and suppose just suppose it was true
the scanty hairs rose on the back of paul s head
a whole spectrum of possibilities scientific financial political suddenly opened up before his eyes and the more he considered them the more awesome they appeared
unlike his devout ancestors dr kreuger had no god to address in moments of crisis or perplexity
now he almost wished he had but even if he could pray that wouldn t really help
as he sat down at his computer and started to access the data banks he did not know whether to hope that his nephew had made a stupendous discovery or was talking utter nonsense
could the old one really play such an incredible trick on mankind
paul remembered einstein s famous comment that though he was subtle he was never malicious
stop daydreaming dr paul kreuger told himself
your likes or dislikes your hopes or fears have absolutely nothing to do with the matter
a challenge had been flung to him across half the width of the solar system he would not know peace until he had uncovered the truth
13 no one told us to bring swimsuits captain smith kept his little surprise until day five just a few hours before turnaround
his announcement was received as he had expected with stunned incredulity
victor willis was the first to recover
a swimming pool
in a spaceship
you must be joking
the captain leaned back and prepared to enjoy himself
he grinned at heywood floyd who had already been let into the secret
well i suppose columbus would have been amazed at some of the facilities on the ships that came after him
is there a diving board
asked greenburg wistfully
i used to be college champion
as a matter of fact yes
it s only five metres but that will give you three seconds of free fall at our nominal tenth of a gee
and if you want a longer time i m sure mr curtis will be happy to reduce thrust
indeed
said the chief engineer dryly
and mess up all my orbit calculations
not to mention the risk of the water crawling out surface tension you know wasn t there a space station once that had a spherical swimming pool
somebody asked
they tried it at the hub of pasteur before they started the spin answered floyd
it just wasn t practical
in zero gravity it had to be completely enclosed
and you could drown rather easily inside a big sphere of water if you panicked
one way of getting into the record books first person to drown in space no one told us to bring swimsuits complained maggie m bala
anyone who has to wear a swimsuit probably should mihailovich whispered to floyd
captain smith rapped on the table to restore order
this is more important please
as you know at midnight we reach maximum speed and have to start braking
so the drive will shut down at 23 and the ship will be reversed
we ll have two hours of weightlessness before we commence thrust again at 1
as you can imagine the crew will be rather busy we ll use the opportunity for an engine check and a hull inspection which can t be done while we re under power
i strongly advise you to be sleeping then with the restraint straps lightly fastened across your beds
the stewards will check that there aren t any loose articles that could cause trouble when weight comes on again
questions
there was a profound silence as if the assembled passengers were still somewhat stunned by the revelation and were deciding what to do about it
i was hoping you d ask me about the economics of such a luxury but as you haven t i ll tell you anyway
it s not a luxury at all it doesn t cost a thing but we hope it will be a very valuable asset on future voyages
you see we have to carry five thousand tons of water as reaction mass so we might as well make the best use of it
number one tank is now three quarters empty we ll keep it that way until the end of the voyage
so after breakfast tomorrow see you down at the beach
considering the rush to get universe spaceborne it was surprising that such a good job had been done on something so spectacularly non essential
the beach was a metal platform about five metres wide curving around a third of the great tank s circumference
although the far wall was only another twenty metres away clever use of projected images made it seem at infinity
borne on the waves in the middle distance surfers were heading towards a shore which they would never reach beyond them a beautiful passenger clipper which any travel agent would recognize instantly as tsung sea space corporation s tai pan was racing along the horizon under a full spread of sail
to complete the illusion there was sand underfoot slightly magnetized so it would not stray too far from its appointed place and the short length of beach ended in a grove of palm trees which were quite convincing until examined too closely
overhead a hot tropical sun completed the idyllic picture it was hard to realize that just beyond these walls the real sun was shining now twice as fiercely as on any terrestrial beach
the designer had really done a wonderful job in the limited space available
it seemed a little unfair of greenburg to complain pity there s no surf 14 search it is a good principle in science not to believe any fact however well attested until it fits into some accepted frame of reference
occasionally of course an observation can shatter the frame and force the construction of a new one but that is extremely rare
galileos and einsteins seldom appear more than once per century which is just as well for the equanimity of mankind
dr kreuger fully accepted this principle he would not believe his nephew s discovery until he could explain it and as far as he could see that required nothing less than a direct act of god
wielding occam s still highly serviceable razor he thought it somewhat more probable that rolf had made a mistake if so it should be fairly easy to find it
to uncle paul s great surprise it proved very difficult indeed
the analysis of radar remote sensing observations was now a venerable and well established art and the experts that paul consulted all gave the same answer after considerable delay
they also asked where did you get that recording
sorry he had answered
i m not at liberty to say
the next step was to assume that the impossible was correct and to start searching the literature
this could be an enormous job for he did not even know where to begin
one thing was quite certain a brute force head on attack was bound to fail
it would be just as if roentgen the morning after he had discovered x rays had started to hunt for their explanation in the physics journals of his day
the information he needed still lay years in the future
but there was at least a sporting chance that what he was looking for was hidden somewhere in the immense body of existing scientific knowledge
slowly and carefully paul kreuger set up an automatic search programme designed for what it would exclude as much as what it would embrace
it should cut out all earth related references they would certainly number in the millions and concentrate entirely on extraterrestrial citations
one of the benefits of dr kreuger s eminence was an unlimited computer budget that was part of the fee he demanded from the various organizations who needed his wisdom
though this search might be expensive he did not have to worry about the bill
as it turned out this was surprisingly small
he was lucky the search came to an end after only two hours thirty seven minutes at the 21 456th reference
the title was enough
paul was so excited that his own comsec refused to recognize his voice and he had to repeat the command for a full print out
nature had published the paper in 1981 almost five years before he was born
and as his eyes swept swiftly over its single page he knew not only that his nephew had been right all along but just as important exactly how such a miracle could occur
the editor of that eighty year old journal must have had a good sense of humour
a paper discussing the cores of the outer planets was not something to grab the usual reader this one however had an unusually striking title
his comsec could have told him quickly enough that it had once been part of a famous song but that of course was quite irrelevant
anyway paul kreuger had never heard of the beatles and their psychedelic fantasies
ii the valley of the black snow 15 rendezvous and now halley was too close to be seen ironically observers back on earth would get a far better view of the tail already stretching fifty million kilometres at right angles to the comet s orbit like a pennant fluttering in the invisible gale of the solar wind
on the morning of the rendezvous heywood floyd woke early from a troubled sleep
it was unusual for him to dream or at least to remember his dreams and doubtless the anticipated excitements of the next few hours were responsible
he was also slightly worried by a message from caroline asking if he had heard from chris lately
he had radioed back a little tersely that chris had never bothered to say thank you when he had helped him get his current position on universe s sister ship cosmos perhaps he was already bored with the earth moon run and was looking for excitement elsewhere
as usual floyd had added we ll hear from him in his own good time
immediately after breakfast passengers and science team had gathered for a final briefing from captain smith
the scientists certainly did not need it but if they felt any irritation so childish an emotion would have been quickly swept away by the weird spectacle on the main viewscreen
it was easier to imagine that universe was flying into a nebula rather than a comet
the entire sky ahead was now a misty white fog not uniform but mottled with darker condensations and streaked with luminous bands and brightly glowing jets all radiating away from a central point
at this magnification the nucleus was barely visible as a tiny black speck yet it was clearly the source of all the phenomena around it
we cut our drive in three hours said the captain
then we ll be only a thousand kilometres away from the nucleus with virtually zero velocity
we ll make some final observations and confirm our landing site
so we ll go weightless at 12 exactly
before then your cabin stewards will check that everything s correctly stowed
it will be just like turnaround except that this time it s going to be three days not two hours before we have weight again
halley s gravity
forget it less than one centimetre per second squared just about a thousandth of earth s
you ll be able to detect it if you wait long enough but that s all
takes fifteen seconds for something to fall a metre
for safety i d like you all here in the observation lounge with your seat belts properly secured during rendezvous and touchdown
you ll get the best view from here anyway and the whole operation won t take more than an hour
we ll only be using very small thrust corrections but they may come from any angle and could cause minor sensory disturbances
what the captain meant of course was spacesickness but that word by general agreement was taboo aboard universe
it was noticeable however that many hands strayed into the compartments beneath the seats as if checking that the notorious plastic bags would be available if urgently required
the image on the viewscreen expanded as the magnification was increased
for a moment it seemed to floyd that he was in an aeroplane descending through light clouds rather than in a spacecraft approaching the most famous of all comets
the nucleus was growing larger and clearer it was no longer a black dot but an irregular ellipse now a small pockmarked island lost in the cosmic ocean then suddenly a world in its own right
there was still no sense of scale
although floyd knew that the whole panorama spread before him was less than ten kilometres across he could easily have imagined that he was looking at a body as large as the moon
but the moon was not hazy around the edges nor did it have little jets of vapour and two large ones spurting from its surface
my god
cried mihailovich what s that
he pointed to the lower edge of the nucleus just inside the terminator
unmistakably impossibly a light was flashing there on the nightside of the comet with a perfectly regular rhythm on off on off once every two or three seconds
dr willis gave his patient i can explain it to you in words of one syllable cough but captain smith got there first
i m sorry to disappoint you mr mihailovich
that s only the beacon on sampler probe two it s been sitting there for a month waiting for us to come and pick it up
what a shame i thought there might be someone something there to welcome us
no such luck i m afraid we re very much on our own out here
that beacon is just where we intend to land it s near halley s south pole and is in permanent darkness at the moment
that will make it easier on our life support systems
the temperature s up to 12 degrees on the sunlit side way above boiling point
no wonder the comet s perking said the unabashed dimitri
those jets don t look very healthy to me
are you sure it s safe to go in
that s another reason we re touching down on the nightside there s no activity there
now if you ll excuse me i must get back to the bridge
this is the first chance i ve ever had of landing on a new world and i doubt if i ll get another
captain smith s audience dispersed slowly and in unusual silence
the image on the viewscreen zoomed back to normal and the nucleus dwindled once more to a barely visible spot
yet even in those few minutes it seemed to have grown slightly larger and perhaps that was no illusion
less than four hours before encounter the ship was still hurtling towards the comet at fifty thousand kilometres an hour
it would make a crater more impressive than any that halley now boasted if something happened to the main drive at this stage of the game
16 touchdown the landing was just as anticlimactic as captain smith had hoped
it was impossible to tell the moment when universe made contact a full minute elapsed before the passengers realized that touchdown was complete and raised a belated cheer
the ship lay at one end of a shallow valley surrounded by hills little more than a hundred metres high
anyone who had been expecting to see a lunar landscape would have been greatly surprised these formations bore no resemblance at all to the smooth gentle slopes of the moon sand blasted by micrometeorite bombardment over billions of years
there was nothing here more than a thousand years old the pyramids were far more ancient than this landscape
every time around the sun halley was remoulded and diminished by the solar fires
even since the 1986 perihelion passage the shape of the nucleus had been subtly changed
melding metaphors shamelessly victor willis had nevertheless put it rather well when he told his viewers the peanut has become wasp waisted
indeed there were indications that after a few more revolutions round the sun halley might split into two roughly equal fragments as had biela s comet to the amazement of the astronomers of 1846
the virtually non existent gravity also contributed to the strangeness of the landscape
all around were spidery formations like the fantasies of a surrealistic artist and improbably canted rockpiles that could not have survived more than a few minutes even on the moon
although captain smith had chosen to land universe in the depths of the polar night all of five kilometres from the blistering heat of the sun there was ample illumination
the huge envelope of gas and dust surrounding the comet formed a glowing halo which seemed appropriate for this region it was easy to imagine that it was an aurora playing over the antarctic ice
and if that was not sufficient lucifer provided its quota of several hundred full moons
although expected the complete absence of colour was a disappointment universe might have been sitting in an opencast coal mine that in fact was not a bad analogy for much of the surrounding blackness was due to carbon or its compounds intimately mixed with snow and ice
captain smith as was his due was the first to leave the ship pushing himself gently out from universe s main airlock
it seemed an eternity before he reached the ground two metres below then he picked up a handful of the powdery surface and examined it in his gloved hand
aboard the ship everyone waited for the words that would go into the history books
looks like pepper and salt said the captain
if it were thawed out it might grow a pretty good crop
the mission plan involved one complete halley day of fifty five hours at the south pole then if there were no problems a move of ten kilometres towards the very ill defined equator to study one of the geysers during a complete day night cycle
chief scientist pendrill wasted no time
almost immediately he set off with a colleague on a two man jet sled towards the beacon of the waiting probe
they were back within the hour bearing prepackaged samples of comet which they proudly consigned to the deep freeze
meanwhile the other teams established a spider s web of cables along the valley strung between poles driven into the friable crust
these served not only to link numerous instruments to the ship but also made movement outside much easier
one could explore this portion of halley without the use of cumbersome external manoeuvring units it was only necessary to attach a tether to a cable and then go along it hand over hand
that was also much more fun than operating emus which were virtually one man spaceships with all the complications they involved
the passengers watched all this with fascination listening to the radioed conversations and trying to join in the excitement of discovery
after about twelve hours considerably less in the case of ex astronaut clifford greenburg the pleasure of being a captive audience started to pall
soon there was much talk about going outside except from victor willis who was quite uncharacteristically subdued
i think he s scared said dimitri contemptuously
he had never liked victor since discovering that the scientist was completely tone deaf
though this was wildly unfair to victor who had gamely allowed himself to be used as a guinea pig for studies of his curious affliction dimitri was fond of adding darkly a man that hath no music in himself is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
floyd had made up his mind even before leaving earth orbit
maggie m was game enough to try anything and would need no encouragement
her slogan an author should never turn down the opportunity for a new experience had impacted famously on her emotional life
yva merlin as usual had kept everyone in suspense but floyd was determined to take her on a personal tour of the comet
it was the very least he could do to maintain his reputation everyone knew that he had been partly responsible for getting the fabulous recluse on the passenger list and now it was a running joke that they were having an affair
their most innocent remarks were gleefully misinterpreted by dimitri and the ship s physician dr mahindran who professed to regard them with envious awe
after some initial annoyance because it all too accurately recalled the emotions of his youth floyd had gone along with the joke
but he did not know how yva felt about it and had so far lacked the courage to ask her
even now in this compact little society where few secrets lasted more than six hours she maintained much of her famous reserve that aura of mystery which had fascinated audiences for three generations
as for victor willis he had just discovered one of those devastating little details that can destroy the best laid plans of mice and spacemen
universe was equipped with the latest mark xx suits with non fogging non reflective visors guaranteed to give an unparalleled view of space
and though the helmets came in several sizes victor willis could not get into any of them without major surgery
it had taken him fifteen years to perfect his trademark a triumph of the topiary art one critic had called it perhaps admiringly
now only his beard stood between victor willis and halley s comet
soon he would have to make a choice between the two
17 the valley of black snow captain smith had raised surprisingly few objections to the idea of passenger evas
he agreed that to have come all this way and not to set foot upon the comet was absurd
there ll be no problems if you follow instructions he said at the inevitable briefing
even if you ve never worn spacesuits before and i believe that only commander greenburg and dr floyd have done so they re quite comfortable and fully automatic
there s no need to bother about any controls or adjustments after you ve been checked out in the airlock
one absolute rule only two of you can go eva at one time
you ll have a personal escort of course linked to you by five metres of safety line though that can be played out to twenty if necessary
in addition you ll both be tethered to the two guide cables we ve strung the whole length of the valley
the rule of the road is the same as on earth keep to the right
if you want to overtake anyone you only have to unclip your buckle but one of you must always remain attached to the line
that way there s no danger of drifting off into space
any questions
how long can we stay out
as long as you like ms m bala
but i recommend that you return just as soon as you feel the slightest discomfort
perhaps an hour would be best for the first outing though it may seem like only ten minutes captain smith had been quite correct
as heywood floyd looked at his time elapsed display it seemed incredible that forty minutes had already passed
yet it should not have been so surprising for the ship was already a good kilometre away
as the senior passenger by almost any reckoning he had been given the privilege of making the first eva
and he really had no choice of companion
eva with yva
chortled mihailovich
how can you possibly resist
even if he added with a lewd grin those damn suits won t let you try all the extravehicular activities you d like yva had agreed without any hesitation yet also without any enthusiasm
that floyd thought wryly was typical
it would not be quite true to say that he was disillusioned at his age he had very few illusions left but he was disappointed
and with himself rather than yva she was as beyond criticism or praise as the mona lisa with whom she had often been compared
the comparison was of course ridiculous la gioconda was mysterious but she was certainly not erotic
yva s power had lain in her unique combination of both with innocence thrown in for good measure
half a century later traces of all three ingredients were still visible at least to the eye of faith
what was lacking as floyd had been sadly forced to admit was any real personality
when he tried to focus his mind upon her all he could visualize were the roles she had played
he would have reluctantly agreed with the critic who had once said yva merlin is the reflection of all men s desires but a mirror has no character
and now this unique and mysterious creature was floating beside him across the face of halley s comet as they and their guide moved along the twin cables that spanned the valley of black snow
that was his name he was childishly proud of it even though it would never appear on any map
there could be no maps of a world where geography was as ephemeral as weather on earth
he savoured the knowledge that no human eye had ever before looked upon the scene around him or ever would again
on mars or on the moon you could sometimes with a slight effort of imagination and if you ignored the alien sky pretend that you were on earth
this was impossible here because the towering often overhanging snow sculptures showed only the slightest concession to gravity
you had to look very carefully at your surroundings to decide which way was up
the valley of black snow was unusual because it was a fairly solid structure a rocky reef embedded in volatile drifts of water and hydrocarbon ice
the geologists were still arguing about its origin some maintaining that it was really part of an asteroid that had encountered the comet ages ago
corings had revealed complex mixtures of organic compounds rather like frozen coal tar though it was certain that life had never played any part in their formation
the snow carpeting of the floor of the little valley was not completely black when floyd raked it with the beam of his flashlight it glittered and sparkled as if embedded with a million microscopic diamonds
he wondered if there were indeed diamonds on halley there was certainly enough carbon here
but it was almost equally certain that the temperatures and pressures necessary to create them had never existed here
on a sudden impulse floyd reached down and gathered two handfuls of the snow he had to push with his feet against the safety line to do so and had a comic vision of himself as a trapeze artist walking a tightrope but upside down
the fragile crust offered virtually no resistance as he buried head and shoulders into it then he pulled gently on his tether and emerged with his handful of halley
he wished that he could feel it through the insulation of his gloves as he compacted the mass of crystalline fluff into a ball that just fitted the palm of his hand
there it lay ebony black yet giving fugitive flashes of light as he turned it from side to side
and suddenly in his imagination it became the purest white and he was a boy again in the winter playground of his youth surrounded with the ghosts of his childhood
he could even hear the cries of his companions taunting and threatening him with their own projectiles of immaculate snow
the memory was brief but shattering for it brought an overwhelming sensation of sadness
across a century of time he could no longer remember a single one of those phantom friends who stood around him yet some he knew he had once loved his eyes filled with tears and his fingers clenched around the ball of alien snow
then the vision faded he was himself again
this was not a moment of sadness but of triumph
my god
cried heywood floyd his words echoing in the tiny reverberant universe of his spacesuit i m standing on halley s comet what more do i want
if a meteor hits me now i won t have a single complaint
he brought up his arms and launched the snowball towards the stars
it was so small and so dark that it vanished almost at once but he kept on staring into the sky
and then abruptly unexpectedly it appeared in a sudden explosion of light as it rose into the rays of the hidden sun
black as soot though it was it reflected enough of that blinding brilliance to be easily visible against the faintly luminous sky
floyd watched it until it finally disappeared perhaps by evaporation perhaps by dwindling into the distance
it would not last long in the fierce torrent of radiation overhead but how many men could claim to have created a comet of their own
18 old faithful the cautious exploration of the comet had already begun while universe still remained in the polar shadow
first one man emus few people now knew that stood for external manoeuvring unit gently jetted over both day and nightside recording everything of interest
once the preliminary surveys had been completed groups of up to five scientists flew out in the onboard shuttle deploying equipment and instruments at strategic spots
the lady jasmine was a far cry from the primitive space pods of the discovery era capable of operating only in a gravity free environment
she was virtually a small spaceship designed to ferry personnel and light cargo between the orbiting universe and the surfaces of mars moon or the jovian satellites
her chief pilot who treated her like the grande dame she was complained with mock bitterness that flying round a miserable little comet was far beneath her dignity
when he was quite sure that halley on the surface at least held no surprises captain smith lifted away from the pole
moving less than a dozen kilometres took universe to a different world from a glimmering twilight that would last for months to a realm that knew the cycle of night and day
and with the dawn the comet came slowly to life
as the sun crept above the jagged absurdly close horizon its rays would slant down into the countless small craters that pockmarked the crust
most of them would remain inactive their narrow throats sealed by incrustations of mineral salts
nowhere else on halley were such vivid displays of colour they had misled biologists into thinking that here life was beginning as it had on earth in the form of algal growths
many had not yet abandoned that hope though they would be reluctant to admit it
from other craters wisps of vapour floated up into the sky moving in unnaturally straight trajectories because there were no winds to divert them
usually nothing else happened for an hour or two then as the sun s warmth penetrated to the frozen interior halley would begin to spurt as victor willis had put it like a pod of whales
though picturesque it was not one of his more accurate metaphors
the jets from the dayside of halley were not intermittent but played steadily for hours at a time
and they did not curl over and fall back to the surface but went rising on up into the sky until they were lost in the glowing fog which they helped create
at first the science team treated the geysers as cautiously as if they were vulcanologists approaching etna or vesuvius in one of their less predictable moods
but they soon discovered that halley s eruptions though often fearsome in appearance were singularly gentle and well behaved the water emerged about as fast as from an ordinary firehose and was barely warm
within seconds of escaping from its underground reservoir it would flash into a mixture of vapour and ice crystals halley was enveloped in a perpetual snowstorm falling upwards
even at this modest speed of ejection none of the water would ever return to its source
each time it rounded the sun more of the comet s life blood would haemorrhage into the insatiable vacuum of space
after considerable persuasion captain smith agreed to move universe to within a hundred metres of old faithful the largest geyser on the dayside
it was an awesome sight a whitish grey column of mist growing like some giant tree from a surprisingly small orifice in a three hundred metre wide crater which appeared to be one of the oldest formations on the comet
before long the scientists were scrambling all over the crater collecting specimens of its completely sterile alas multi coloured minerals and casually thrusting their thermometers and sampling tubes into the soaring water ice mist column itself
if it tosses any of you out into space warned the captain don t expect to be rescued in a hurry
in fact we may just wait until you come back
what does he mean by that
a puzzled dimitri mihailovich had asked
as usual victor willis was quick with the answer
things don t always happen the way you d expect in celestial mechanics
anything thrown off halley at a reasonable speed will still be moving in essentially the same orbit it takes a huge velocity change to make a big differenc
so one revolution later the two orbits will intersect again and you ll be right back where you started
seventy six years older of course
not far from old faithful was another phenomenon which no one could reasonably have anticipated
when they first observed it the scientists could scarcely believe their eyes
spread out across several hectares of halley exposed to the vacuum of space was what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary lake remarkable only for its extreme blackness
obviously it could not be water the only liquids which could be stable in this environment were heavy organic oils or tars
in fact lake tuonela turned out to be more like pitch quite solid except for a sticky surface layer less than a millimetre thick
in this negligible gravity it must have taken years perhaps several trips round the warming fires of the sun for it to have assumed its present mirror flatness
until the captain put a stop to it the lake became one of the principal tourist attractions on halley s comet
someone nobody claimed the dubious honour discovered that it was possible to walk perfectly normally across it almost as if on earth the surface film had just enough adhesion to hold the foot in place
before long most of the crew had got themselves videoed apparently walking on water then captain smith inspected the airlock discovered the walls liberally stained with tar and gave the nearest thing to a display of anger that anyone had ever witnessed from him
it s bad enough he said through clenched teeth having the outside of the ship coated with soot
halley s comet is about the filthiest place i ve ever seen after that there were no more strolls on lake tuonela
19 at the end of the tunnel in a small self contained universe where everyone knows everyone else there can be no greater shock than encountering a total stranger
heywood floyd was floating gently along the corridor to the main lounge when he had this disturbing experience
he stared in amazement at the interloper wondering how a stowaway had managed to avoid detection for so long
the other man looked back at him with a combination of embarrassment and bravado obviously waiting for floyd to speak first
well victor
he said at last
sorry i didn t recognize you
so you ve made the supreme sacrifice for the cause of science or should i say your public
yes willis answered grumpily
i did manage to squeeze into one helmet but the damn bristles made so many scratching noises no one could hear a word i said
when are you going out
just as soon as cliff comes back he s gone caving with bill chant
the first flybys of the comet in 1986 had suggested that it was considerably less dense than water which could only mean that it was either made of very porous material or was riddled with cavities
both explanations turned out to be correct
at first the ever cautious captain smith flatly forbade any cave exploring
he finally relented when dr pendrill reminded him that his chief assistant dr chant was an experienced speleologist indeed that was one of the very reasons he had been chosen for the mission
cave ins are impossible in this low gravity pendrill had told the reluctant captain
so there s no danger of being trapped
what about being lost
chant would regard that suggestion as a professional insult
he s been twenty kilometres inside mammoth cave
anyway he ll play out a guideline
communications
the line s got fibre optics in it
and his suit radio will probably work most of the way
umm
where does he want to go in
the best place is that extinct geyser at the base of etna junior
it s been dead for at least a thousand years
so i suppose it should keep quiet for another couple of days
very well does anyone else want to go
cliff greenburg has volunteered he s done a good deal of underwater cave exploring in the bahamas
i tried it once that was enough
tell cliff he s much too valuable
he can go in as far as he can still see the entrance and no further
and if he loses contact with chant he s not to go after him without my authority
which the captain added to himself i would be very reluctant to give dr chant knew all the old jokes about speleologists wanting to return to the womb and was quite sure he could refute them
that must be a damn noisy place with all its thumpings and bumpings and gurglings he argued
i love caves because they re so peaceful and timeless
you know that nothing has changed for a hundred thousand years except that the stalactites have grown a bit thicker
but now as he drifted deeper into halley playing out the thin but virtually unbreakable thread that linked him to clifford greenburg he realized that this was no longer true
as yet he had no scientific proof but his geologist s instincts told him that this subterranean world had been born only yesterday on the time scale of the universe
it was younger than some of the cities of man
the tunnel through which he was gliding in long shallow leaps was about four metres in diameter and his virtual weightlessness brought back vivid memories of cave diving on earth
the low gravity contributed to the illusion it was exactly as if he was carrying slightly too much weight and so kept drifting gently downwards
only the absence of all resistance reminded him that he was moving through vacuum not water
you re just getting out of sight said greenburg fifty metres in from the entrance
radio link still fine
what s the scenery like
very hard to say i can t identify any formations so i don t have the vocabulary to describe them
it s not any kind of rock it crumbles when i touch it i feel as if i m exploring a giant gruy re cheese
you mean it s organic
yes nothing to do with life of course but perfect raw material for it
all sorts of hydrocarbons the chemists will have fun with these samples
can you still see me
only the glow of your light and that s fading fast
ah here s some genuine rock doesn t look as if it belongs here probably an intrusion ah i ve struck gold
you re joking
it fooled a lot of people in the old west iron pyrites
common on the outer satellites of course but don t ask me what it s doing here visual contact lost
you re two hundred metres in
i m passing through a distinct layer looks like meteoric debris something exciting must have happened back then i hope we can date it wow
don t do that sort of thing to me
sorry quite took my breath away there s a big chamber ahead last thing i expected let me swing the beam around almost spherical thirty forty metres across
and i don t believe it halley is full of surprises stalactites stalagmites
what s so surprising about that
no free water no limestone here of course and such low gravity
looks like some kind of wax
just a minute while i get good video coverage fantastic shapes sort of thing a dripping candle makes that s odd now what
dr chant s voice had shown a sudden alteration in tone which greenburg had instantly detected
some of the columns have been broken
they re lying on the floor
it s almost as if go on
as if something has blundered into them
that s crazy
could an earthquake have snapped them
no earthquakes here only microseisms from the geysers
perhaps there was a big blow out at some time
anyway it was centuries ago
there s a film of this wax stuff over the fallen columns several millimetres thick
dr chant was slowly recovering his composure
he was not a highly imaginative man spelunking eliminates such men rather quickly but the very feel of the place had triggered some disturbing memory
and those fallen columns looked altogether too much like the bars of a cage broken by some monster in an attempt to escape
of course that was perfectly absurd but dr chant had learned never to ignore any premonition any danger signal until he had traced it to its origin
that caution had saved his life more than once he would not go beyond this chamber until he had identified the source of his fear
and he was honest enough to admit that fear was the correct word
bill are you all right
what s happening
still filming
some of these shapes remind me of indian temple sculpture
almost erotic
he was deliberately turning his mind away from the direct confrontation of his fears hoping thereby to sneak up on them unawares by a kind of averted mental vision
meanwhile the purely mechanical acts of recording and collecting samples occupied most of his attention
there was nothing wrong he reminded himself with healthy fear only when it escalated into panic did it become a killer
he had known panic twice in his life once on a mountainside once underwater and still shuddered at the memory of its clammy touch
yet thankfully he was far from it now and for a reason which though he did not understand it he found curiously reassuring
there was an element of comedy in the situation
and presently he started to laugh not with hysteria but with relief
did you ever see those old star wars movies
he asked greenburg
of course half a dozen times
well i know what s been bothering me
there was a sequence when luke s spaceship dives into an asteroid and runs into a gigantic snake creature that lurks inside its caverns
not luke s ship hans solo s millennium falcon
and i always wondered how that poor beast managed to eke out a living
it must have grown very hungry waiting for the occasional titbit from space
and princess leia wouldn t have been more than an hors d oeuvre anyway
which i certainly don t intend to provide said dr chant now completely at ease
even if there is life here which would be marvellous the food chain would be very short
so i d be surprised to find anything bigger than a mouse
or more likely a mushroom now let s see where do we go from here
there are two exits on the other side of the chamber the one on the right is bigger
i ll take that how much more line have you got
oh a good half kilometre
here we go
i m in the middle of the chamber damn bounced off the wall now i ve got a hand hold going in head first smooth walls real rock for a change that s a pity what s the problem
can t go any further
more stalactites too close together for me to get through and too thick to break without explosives
and that would be a shame the colours are beautiful first real greens and blues i ve seen on halley
just a minute while i get them on video dr chant braced himself against the wall of the narrow tunnel and aimed the camera
with his gloved fingers be reached for the hi intensity switch but missed it and cut off the main lights completely
lousy design he muttered
third time i ve done that
he did not immediately correct his mistake because he had always enjoyed that silence and total darkness which can be experienced only in the deepest caves
the gentle background noises of his life support equipment robbed him of the silence but at least what was that
from beyond the portcullis of stalactites blocking further progress he could see a faint glow like the first light of dawn
as his eyes grew adapted to the darkness it appeared to grow brighter and he could detect a hint of green
now he could even see the outlines of the barrier ahead
what s happening
said greenburg anxiously
nothing just observing
and thinking he might have added
there were four possible explanations
sunlight could be filtering down through some natural light duct ice crystal whatever
but at this depth
unlikely
radioactivity
he hadn t bothered to bring a counter there were virtually no heavy elements here
but it would be worth coming back to check
some phosphorescent mineral that was the one he d put his money on
but there was a fourth possibility the most unlikely and most exciting of all
dr chant had never forgotten a moonless and luciferless night on the shores of the indian ocean when he had been walking beneath brilliant stars along a sandy beach
the sea was very calm but from time to time a languid wave would collapse at his feet and detonate in an explosion of light
he had walked out into the shallows he could still remember the feel of the water round his ankles like a warm bath and with every step he took there had been another burst of light
he could even trigger it by clapping his hands close to the surface
could similar bioluminescent organisms have evolved here in the heart of halley s comet
he would love to think so
it seemed a pity to vandalize something so exquisite as this natural work of art with the glow behind it the barrier now reminded him of an altar screen he had once seen in some cathedral but he would have to go back and get some explosives
meanwhile there was the other corridor i can t get any further along this route he told greenburg so i ll try the other
coming back to the junction setting the reel on rewind
he did not mention the mysterious glow which had vanished as soon as he switched on his lights again
greenburg did not reply immediately which was unusual probably he was talking to the ship
chant did not worry he would repeat his message as soon as he had got under way again
he did not bother because there was a brief acknowledgement from greenburg
fine cliff thought i d lost you for a minute
back at the chamber now going into the other tunnel hope there s nothing blocking that
this time greenburg replied at once
sorry bill
come back to the ship
there s an emergency no not here everything s fine with universe
but we may have to return to earth at once
it was only a few weeks before dr chant discovered a very plausible explanation for the broken columns
as the comet blasted its substance away into space at each perihelion passage its mass distribution continually altered
and so every few thousand years its spin became unstable and it would change the direction of its axis quite violently like a top that is about to fall over as it loses energy
when that occurred the resulting cometquake could reach a respectable five on the richter scale
but he never solved the mystery of the luminous glow
though the problem was swiftly overshadowed by the drama that was now unfolding the sense of a missed opportunity would continue to haunt him for the rest of his life
though he was occasionally tempted he never mentioned it to any of his colleagues
but he did leave a sealed note for the next expedition to be opened in 2133
2 recall have you seen victor
said mihailovich gleefully as floyd hurried to answer the captain s summons
he s a broken man
he ll grow it back on the way home snapped floyd who had no time for such trivialities at the moment
i m trying to find out what s happened
captain smith was still sitting almost stunned in his cabin when he arrived
if this was an emergency affecting his own ship he would have been a tornado of controlled energy issuing orders right and left
but there was nothing he could do about this situation except await the next message from earth
captain laplace was an old friend how could he have got into such a mess
there was no conceivable accident error of navigation or failure of equipment that could possibly account for his predicament
nor as far as smith could see was there any way in which universe could help him get out of it
operations centre was just running round and round in circles this looked like one of those emergencies all too common in space where nothing could be done except transmit condolences and record last messages
but he gave no hint of his doubts and reservations when he reported the news to floyd
there s been an accident he said
we ve received orders to return to earth immediately to be fitted out for a rescue mission
what kind of accident
it s our sister ship galaxy
she was doing a survey of the jovian satellites
and she s made a crash landing
he saw the look of amazed incredulity on floyd s face
yes i know that s impossible
but you ve not heard anything yet
she s stranded on europa
europa
i m afraid so
she s damaged but apparently there s no loss of life
we re still awaiting details
when did it happen
twelve hours ago
there was a delay before she could report to ganymede
but what can we do
we re on the other side of the solar system
getting back to lunar orbit to refuel then taking the fastest orbit to jupiter it would be oh at least a couple of months
and back in leonov s day floyd added to himself it would have been a couple of years i know but there s no other ship that could do anything
what about ganymede s own inter satellite ferries
they re only designed for orbital operations
they ve landed on callisto
much lower energy mission
oh they could just manage europa but with negligible payload
it s being looked into of course
floyd scarcely heard the captain he was still trying to assimilate this astonishing news
for the first time in half a century and only for the second time in all history
a ship had landed on the forbidden moon
and that prompted an ominous thought
do you suppose he asked that whoever whatever is on europa could be responsible
i was wondering about that said the captain glumly
but we ve been snooping around the place for years without anything happening
even more to the point what might happen to us if we attempted a rescue
that s the first thing that occurred to me
but all this is speculation we ll have to wait until we have more facts
meanwhile this is really why i called you i ve just received galaxy s crew manifest and i was wondering hesitantly he pushed the print out across his desk
but even before heywood floyd scanned the list he somehow knew what he would find
my grandson he said bleakly
and he added to himself the only person who can carry my name beyond the grave
iii europan roulette 21 the politics of exile despite all the gloomier forecasts the south african revolution had been comparatively bloodless as such things go
television which had been blamed for many evils deserved some credit for this
a precedent had been set a generation earlier in the philippines when they know that the world is watching the great majority of men and women tend to behave in a responsible manner
though there have been shameful exceptions few massacres occur on camera
most of the afrikaners when they recognized the inevitable had left the country long before the takeover of power
and as the new administration bitterly complained they had not gone empty handed
billions of rands had been transferred to swiss and dutch banks towards the end there had been mysterious flights almost every hour out of cape town and jo burg to zurich and amsterdam
it was said that by freedom day one would not find one troy ounce of gold or a carat of diamond in the late republic of south africa and the mine workings had been effectively sabotaged
one prominent refugee boasted from his luxury apartment in the hague it will be five years before the kaffirs can get kimberley working again if they ever do
to his great surprise de beers was back in business under new name and management in less than five weeks and diamonds were now the single most important element in the new nation s economy
within a generation the younger refugees had been absorbed despite desperate rearguard actions by their conservative elders in the deracinated culture of the twenty first century
they recalled with pride but without boastfulness the courage and determination of their ancestors and distanced themselves from their stupidities
virtually none of them spoke afrikaans even in their own homes
yet precisely as in the case of the russian revolution a century earlier there were many who dreamed of putting back the clock or at least of sabotaging the efforts of those who had usurped their power and privilege
usually they channelled their frustration and bitterness into propaganda demonstrations boycotts petitions to the world council and rarely works of art
wilhelm smuts the voortrekkers was conceded to be a masterpiece of ironically english literature even by those who bitterly disagreed with the author
but there were also groups who believed that political action was useless and that only violence would restore the longed for status quo
although there could not have been many who really imagined that they could rewrite the pages of history there were not a few who if victory was impossible would gladly settle for revenge
between the two extremes of the totally assimilated and the completely intransigent there was an entire spectrum of political and apolitical parties
der bund was not the largest but it was the most powerful and certainly the richest since it controlled much of the lost republic s smuggled wealth through a network of corporations and holding companies
most of these were now perfectly legal and indeed completely respectable
there was half a billion of bund money in tsung aerospace duly listed in the annual balance sheet
in 2 59 sir lawrence was happy to receive another half billion which enabled him to accelerate the commissioning of his little fleet
but not even his excellent intelligence traced any connection between the bund and tsung aerospace s latest charter mission in any event halley was then approaching mars and sir lawrence was so busy getting universe ready to leave on schedule that he paid little attention to the routine operations of her sister ships
though lloyd s of london did raise some queries about galaxy s proposed routing these objections were quickly dealt with
the bund had people in key positions everywhere which was unfortunate for the insurance brokers but very good luck for the space lawyers
22 hazardous cargo it is not easy to run a shipping line between destinations which not only change their positions by millions of kilometres every few days but also swing through a velocity range of tens of kilometres a second
anything like a regular schedule is out of the question there are times when one must forget the whole idea and stay in port or at least in orbit waiting for the solar system to rearrange itself for the greater convenience of mankind
fortunately these periods are known years in advance so it is possible to make the best use of them for overhauls retrofits and planet leave for the crew
and occasionally by good luck and aggressive salesmanship one can arrange some local chartering even if only the equivalent of the old time once around the bay boat ride
captain eric laplace was delighted that the three month stayover off ganymede would not be a complete loss
an anonymous and unexpected grant to the planetary science foundation would finance a reconnaissance of the jovian even now no one ever called it luciferian satellite system paying particular attention to a dozen of the neglected smaller moons
some of these had never even been properly surveyed much less visited
as soon as he heard of the mission rolf van der berg called the tsung shipping agent and made some discreet enquiries
yes first we ll head in towards io then do a flyby of europa only a flyby
how close
just a moment odd the flight plan doesn t give details
but of course she won t go inside the interdiction zone
which was down to ten thousand kilometres at the last ruling fifteen years ago
anyway i d like to volunteer as mission planetologist
i ll send across my qualifications no need to do so dr van der berg
they ve already asked for you
it is always easy to be wise after the event and when he cast his mind back he had plenty of time for it later captain laplace recalled a number of curious aspects of the charter
two crew members were taken suddenly sick and were replaced at short notice he was so glad to have substitutes that he did not check their papers as closely as he might have done
and even if he had he would have discovered that they were perfectly in order
then there was the trouble with the cargo
as captain he was entitled to inspect anything that went aboard the ship
of course it was impossible to do this for every item but he never hesitated to investigate if he had good reason
space crews were on the whole a highly responsible body of men but long missions could be boring and there were tedium relieving chemicals which though perfectly legal on earth should be discouraged off it
when second officer chris floyd reported his suspicions the captain assumed that the ship s chromatographic sniffer had detected another cache of the high grade opium which his largely chinese crew occasionally patronized
this time however the matter was serious very serious
cargo hold three item 2 456 captain
the manifest says scientific apparatus
it contains explosives
what
definitely sir
here s the electrogram
i ll take your word for it mr floyd
have you inspected the item
no sir
it s in a sealed crew case half a metre by one metre by five metres approximately
one of the largest packages the science team brought aboard
it s labelled fragile handle with care
but so is everything of course
captain laplace drummed his fingers thoughtfully on the grained plastic wood of his desk
he hated the pattern and intended to get rid of it on the next refit
even that slight action started him rising out of his seat and he automatically anchored himself by wrapping his foot around the pillar of the chair
though he did not for a moment doubt floyd s report his new second officer was very competent and the captain was pleased that he had never brought up the subject of his famous grandfather there could be an innocent explanation
the sniffer might have been misled by other chemicals with nervous molecular bondings
they could go down into the hold and force open the package
no that might be dangerous and could cause legal problems as well
best to go straight to the top he d have to do that anyway sooner or later
please bring dr anderson here and don t mention this to anyone else very good sir
chris floyd gave a respectful but quite unnecessary salute and left the room in a smooth effortless glide
the leader of the science team was not accustomed to zero gravity and his entrance was quite clumsy
his obvious genuine indignation did not help and he had to grab the captain s desk several times in an undignified manner
explosives
of course not
let me see the manifest 2 456 dr anderson pecked out the reference on his portable keyboard and slowly read off mark v penetrometers quantity three
of course no problem
and just what said the captain is a penetrometer
despite his concern he had difficulty in suppressing a smile it sounded a little obscene
standard planetary sampling device
you drop it and with any luck it will give you a core up to ten metres long even in hard rock
then it sends back a complete chemical analysis
the only safe way to study places like dayside mercury or io where we ll drop the first one
dr anderson said the captain with great selfrestraint you may be an excellent geologist but you don t know much about celestial mechanics
you can t just drop things from orbit the charge of ignorance was clearly unfounded as the scientist s reaction proved
the idiots
he said
of course you should have been notified
exactly
solid fuel rockets are classified as hazardous cargo
i want clearance from the underwriters and your personal assurance that the safety systems are adequate otherwise they go overboard
now any other little surprises
were you planning seismic surveys
i believe those usually involve explosives a few hours later the somewhat chastened scientist admitted that he had also found two bottles of elemental fluorine used to power the lasers which could zap passing celestial bodies at thousand kilometre ranges for spectrographic sampling
as pure fluorine was about the most vicious substance known to man it was high on the list of prohibited materials but like the rockets which drove the penetrometers down to their targets it was essential for the mission
when he was quite satisfied that all the necessary precautions had been taken captain laplace accepted the scientist s apologies and his assurance that the oversight was entirely due to the haste with which the expedition had been organized
he felt sure that dr anderson was telling the truth but already he felt that there was something odd about the mission
just how odd he could never have imagined
23 inferno before the detonation of jupiter io had been second only to venus as the best approximation to hell in the solar system
now that lucifer had raised its surface temperature another couple of hundred degrees even venus could no longer compete
the sulphur volcanoes and geysers had multiplied their activity now reshaping the features of the tormented satellite in years rather than decades
the planetologists had given up any attempt at mapmaking and contented themselves with taking orbital photographs every few days
from these they had constructed awe inspiring time lapse movies of inferno in action
lloyd s of london had charged a stiff premium for this leg of the mission but io posed no real danger to a ship doing a flyby at a minimum range of ten thousand kilometres and over the relatively quiescent nightside at that
as he watched the approaching yellow and orange globe the most improbably garish object in the entire solar system second officer chris floyd could not help recalling the time now half a century ago when his grandfather had come this way
here leonov had made its rendezvous with the abandoned discovery and here dr chandra had reawakened the dormant computer hal
then both ships had flown on to survey the enormous black monolith hovering at l1 the inner lagrange point between io and jupiter
now the monolith was gone and so was jupiter
the minisun that had risen like a phoenix from the implosion of the giant planet had turned its satellites into what was virtually another solar system though only on ganymede and europa were there regions with earthlike temperatures
how long that would continue to be the case no one knew
estimates of lucifer s life span ranged from a thousand to a million years
galaxy s science team looked wistfully at the l1 point but it was now far too dangerous to approach
there had always been a river of electrical energy the io flux tube flowing between jupiter and its inner satellite and the creation of lucifer had increased its strength several hundredfold
sometimes the river of power could even be seen by the naked eye glowing yellow with the characteristic light of ionized sodium
some engineers on ganymede had talked hopefully about tapping the gigawatts going to waste next door but no one could think of a plausible way of doing so
the first penetrometer was launched with vulgar comments from the crew and two hours later drove like a hypodermic needle into the festering satellite
it continued to operate for almost five seconds ten times its designed lifetime broadcasting thousands of chemical physical and rheological measurements before io demolished it
the scientists were ecstatic van der berg was merely pleased
he had expected the probe to work io was an absurdly easy target
but if he was right about europa the second penetrometer would surely fail
yet that would prove nothing it might fail for a dozen good reasons
and when it did there would be no alternative but a landing
which of course was totally prohibited not only by the laws of man
24 shaka the great astropol which despite its grandiose title had disappointingly little business off earth would not admit that shaka really existed
the ussa took exactly the same position and its diplomats became embarrassed or indignant when anyone was tactless enough to mention the name
but newton s third law applies in politics as in everything else
the bund had its extremists though it tried sometimes not very hard to disown them continually plotting against the ussa
usually they confined themselves to attempts at commercial sabotage but there were occasional explosions disappearances and even assassinations
needless to say the south africans did not take this lightly
they reacted by establishing their own official counter intelligence services which also had a rather free wheeling range of operations and likewise claimed to know nothing about shaka
perhaps they were employing the useful cia invention of plausible deniability
it is even possible that they were telling the truth
according to one theory shaka started as a codeword and then rather like prokofiev s lieutenant kije had acquired a life of its own because it was useful to various clandestine bureaucracies
this would certainly account for the fact that none of its members had ever defected or even been arrested
but there was another somewhat far fetched explanation for this according to those who believed that shaka really did exist
all its agents had been psychologically conditioned to self destruct before there was any possibility of interrogation
whatever the truth no one could seriously imagine that more than two centuries after his death the legend of the great zulu tyrant would cast its shadow across worlds he never knew
25 the shrouded world during the decade after the ignition of jupiter and the spreading of the great thaw across its satellite system europa had been left strictly alone
then the chinese had made a swift flyby probing the clouds with radar in an attempt to locate the wreck of the tsien
they had been unsuccessful but their maps of dayside were the first to show the new continents now emerging as the ice cover melted
they had also discovered a perfectly straight two kilometre long feature which looked so artificial that it was christened the great wall
because of its shape and size it was assumed to be the monolith or a monolith since millions had been replicated in the hours before the creation of lucifer
however there had been no reaction or any hint of an intelligent signal from below the steadily thickening clouds
so a few years later survey satellites were placed in permanent orbit and high altitude balloons were dropped into the atmosphere to study its wind patterns
terrestrial meteorologists found these of absorbing interest because europa with a central ocean and a sun that never set presented a beautifully simplified model for their text books
so had begun the game of europan roulette as the administrators were fond of calling it whenever the scientists proposed getting closer to the satellite
after fifty uneventful years it had become somewhat boring
captain laplace hoped it would remain that way and had required considerable reassurance from dr anderson
personally he had told the scientist i would regard it as a slightly unfriendly act to have a ton of armour piercing hardware dropped on me at a thousand kilometres an hour
i m quite surprised the world council gave you permission
dr anderson was also a little surprised though he might not have been had he known that the project was the last item on a long agenda of a science subcommittee late on a friday afternoon
of such trifles history is made
i agree captain
but we are operating under very strict limitations and there s no possibility of interfering with the ah europans whoever they are
we re aiming at a target five kilometres above sea level
so i understand
what s so interesting about mount zeus
it s a total mystery
it wasn t even there only a few years ago
so you can understand why it drives the geologists crazy
and your gadget will analyse it when it goes in
exactly
and i really shouldn t be telling you this but i ve been asked to keep the results confidential and to send them back to earth encrypted
obviously someone s on the track of a major discovery and wants to make quite sure they re not beaten to a publication
would you believe that scientists could be so petty
captain laplace could well believe it but did not want to disillusion his passenger
dr anderson seemed touchingly na ve whatever was going on and the captain was now quite certain there was much more to this mission than met the eye anderson knew nothing about it
i can only hope doctor that the europans don t go in for mountain climbing
i d hate to interrupt any attempt to put a flag on their local everest
there was a feeling of unusual excitement aboard galaxy when the penetrometer was launched and even the inevitable jokes were muted
during the two hours of the probe s long fall towards europa virtually every member of the crew found some perfectly legitimate excuse to visit the bridge and watch the guidance operation
fifteen minutes before impact captain laplace declared it out of bounds to all visitors except the ship s new steward rosie without her endless supply of squeezebulbs full of excellent coffee the operation could not have continued
everything went perfectly
soon after atmospheric entry the air brakes were deployed slowing the penetrometer to an acceptable impact velocity
the radar image of the target featureless with no indication of scale grew steadily on the screen
at minus one second all the recorders switched automatically to high speed
but there was nothing to record
now i know said dr anderson sadly just how they felt at the jet propulsion lab when those first rangers crashed into the moon with their cameras blind
26 night watch only time is universal night and day are merely quaint local customs found on those planets which tidal forces have not yet robbed of their rotation
but however far they travel from their native world human beings can never escape the diurnal rhythm set ages ago by its cycle of light and darkness
so at 1 5 universal time second officer chang was alone on the bridge while the ship was sleeping around him
there was no real need for him to be awake either since galaxy s electronic senses would detect any malfunction far sooner than he could possibly do
but a century of cybernetics had proved that human beings were still slightly better than machines at dealing with the unexpected and sooner or later the unexpected always happened
where s my coffee
thought chang grumpily
it s not like rosie to be late
he wondered if the steward had been affected by the same malaise that had overtaken both scientists and space crew after the disasters of the last twenty four hours
following the failure of the first penetrometer there had been a hasty conference to decide the next step
one unit was left it had been intended for callisto but it could be used just as easily here
and anyway dr anderson had argued we ve landed on callisto there s nothing there except assorted varieties of cracked ice
there had been no disagreement
after a twelve hour delay for modification and testing pen no
3 was launched into the europan cloudscape following the invisible track of its precursor
this time the ship s recorders did get some data for about half a millisecond
the accelerometer on the probe which was calibrated to operate up to 2 gee gave one brief pulse before going off scale
everything must have been destroyed in very much less than the twinkling of an eye
after a second and even gloomier post mortem it was decided to report to earth and wait in high orbit round europa for any further instructions before proceeding to callisto and the outer moons sorry to be late sir said rose mccullen one would never guess from her name that she was slightly darker than the coffee she was carrying but i must have set the alarm wrong
lucky for us chuckled the officer of the watch that you re not running the ship
i don t understand how anyone could run it answered rose
it all looks so complicated
oh it s not as bad as it looks said chang
and don t they give you basic space theory in your training course
er yes
but i never understood much of it
orbits and all that nonsense
second officer chang was bored and felt it would be a kindness to enlighten his audience
and although rose was not exactly his type she was undoubtedly attractive a little effort now might be a worthwhile investment
it never occurred to him that having performed her duty rose might like to go back to sleep
twenty minutes later second officer chang waved at the navigation console and concluded expansively so you see it s really almost automatic
you only have to punch in a few numbers and the ship takes care of the rest
rose seemed to be getting tired she kept looking at her watch
i m sorry said the suddenly contrite chang
i shouldn t have kept you up
oh no it s extremely interesting
please go on
definitely not
maybe some other time
goodnight rosie and thanks for the coffee
goodnight sir
steward third class rose mccullen glided not too skilfully towards the still open door
chang did not bother to look back when he heard it close
it was thus a considerable shock when a few seconds later he was addressed by a completely unfamiliar female voice
mr chang don t bother to touch the alarm button it s disconnected
here are the landing coordinates
take the ship down
slowly wondering if he had somehow dozed off and was having a nightmare chang rotated his chair
the person who had been rose mccullen was floating beside the oval hatchway steadying herself by holding on to the locking lever of the door
everything about her seemed to have changed in a moment of time their roles had been reversed
the shy steward who had never before looked at him directly was now regarding chang with a cold merciless stare that made him feel like a rabbit hypnotized by a snake
the small but deadly looking gun nestling in her free hand seemed an unnecessary adornment chang had not the slightest doubt that she could very efficiently kill him without it
nevertheless both his self respect and his professional honour demanded that he should not surrender without some sort of a struggle
at the very least he might be able to gain time
rose he said and now his lips had difficulty in forming a name which had become suddenly inappropriate this is perfectly ridiculous
what i told you just now it s simply not true
i couldn t possibly land the ship by myself
it would take hours to compute the correct orbit and i d need someone to help me
a co pilot at least
the gun did not waver
i m not a fool mr chang
this ship isn t energy limited like the old chemical rockets
the escape velocity of europa is only three kilometres a second
part of your training is an emergency landing with the main computer down
now you can put it into practice the window for an optimum touchdown at the coordinates i will give you opens in five minutes
that type of abort said chang now beginning to sweat profusely has an estimated twenty five per cent failure rate the true figure was ten per cent but in the circumstances he felt that a little exaggeration was justified and it s years since i checked out on it
in that case answered rose mccullen i ll have to eliminate you and ask the captain to send me someone more qualified
annoying because we ll miss this window and have to wait a couple of hours for the next one
four minutes left
second officer chang knew when he was beaten but at least he had tried
let me have those coordinates he said
27 rosie captain laplace woke instantly at the first gentle tapping like a distant woodpecker of the attitude control jets
for a moment he wondered if he was dreaming no the ship was definitely turning in space
perhaps it was getting too hot on one side and the thermal control system was making some minor adjustments
that did happen occasionally and was a black mark for the officer on duty who should have noticed that the temperature envelope was being approached
he reached for the intercom button to call who was it
mr chang on the bridge
his hand never completed the movement
after days of weightlessness even a tenth of a gravity is a shock
to the captain it seemed like minutes though it must have been only a few seconds before he could unbuckle his restraining harness and struggle out of his bunk
this time he found the button and jabbed it viciously
there was no reply
he tried to ignore the thuds and bumps of inadequately secured objects that had been taken unawares by the onset of gravity
things seemed to go on falling for a long time but presently the only abnormal sound was the muffled far off scream of the drive at full blast
he tore open the curtain of the cabin s little window and looked out at the stars
he knew roughly where the ship s axis should have been pointing even if he could only judge it to within thirty or forty degrees that would allow him to distinguish between the two possible alternatives
galaxy could be vectored either to gain or to lose orbital velocity
it was losing it and therefore preparing to fall towards europa
there was an insistent banging on the door and the captain realized that little more than a minute could really have passed
second officer floyd and two other crew members were crowded in the narrow passageway
the bridge is locked sir floyd reported breathlessly
we can t get in and chang doesn t answer
we don t know what s happened
i m afraid i do captain laplace answered climbing into his shorts
some madman was bound to try it sooner or later
we ve been hijacked and i know where
but i m damned if i know why
he glanced at his watch and did a quick mental calculation
at this thrust level we ll have deorbited within fifteen minutes make it ten for safety
any way we can cut the drive without endangering the ship
second officer yu engineering looked very unhappy but volunteered a reluctant reply
we could pull the circuit breakers in the pump motor lines and cut off the propellant supply
can we get at them
yes they re on deck three
then let s go
er then the independent backup system would take over
for safety that s behind a sealed bulkhead on deck five we d have to get a cutter no it couldn t be done in time
captain laplace had been afraid of that
the men of genius who had designed galaxy had tried to protect the ship from all plausible accidents
there was no way they could have safeguarded it against human malevolence
any alternatives
not in the time available i m afraid
then let s get to the bridge and see if we can talk to chang and whoever is with him
and who could that be
he wondered
he refused to believe that it could be one of his regular crew
that left of course there was the answer
he could see it all
monomaniac researcher tries to prove theory experiments frustrated decides that the quest for knowledge takes precedence over everything else
it was uncomfortably like one of those cheap mad scientist melodramas but it fitted the facts perfectly
he wondered if dr anderson had decided that this was the only road to a nobel prize
that theory was swiftly demolished when the breathless and dishevelled geologist arrived gasping for god s sake captain what s happening
we re under full thrust
are we going up or down
down answered captain laplace
in about ten minutes we ll be in an orbit that will hit europa
i can only hope that whoever s at the controls knows what he s doing
now they were at the bridge facing the closed door
not a sound came from the far side
laplate rapped as loudly as he possibly could without bruising his knuckles
this is the captain
let us in
he felt rather foolish at giving an order which would certainly be ignored but he hoped for at least some reaction
to his surprise he got one
the external speaker hissed into life and a voice said don t attempt anything foolish captain
i have a gun and mr chang is obeying my orders
who was that
whispered one of the officers
it sounds like a woman
you re right said the captain grimly
that certainly cut down the alternatives but didn t help matters in any way
what do you hope to do
you know you can t possibly get away with it
he shouted trying to sound masterful rather than plaintive
we re landing on europa
and if you want to take off again don t try to stop me
her room s completely clean second officer chris floyd reported thirty minutes later when the thrust had been cut to zero and galaxy was falling along the ellipse which would soon graze the atmosphere of europa
they were now committed although it would now be possible to immobilize the engines it would be suicide to do so
they would be needed again to make a landing although that could be merely a more protracted form of suicide
rosie mccullen
who would have believed it
do you suppose she s on drugs
no said floyd
this has been very carefully planned
she must have a radio hidden somewhere in the ship
we should search for it
you sound like a damned cop
that will do gentlemen said the captain
tempers were getting frayed largely through sheer frustration and the total failure to establish any further contact with the barricaded bridge
he glanced at his watch
less than two hours before we enter atmosphere what there is of it
i ll be in my cabin it s just possible they may try to call me there
mr yu please stand by the bridge and report any developments at once
he had never felt so helpless in his life but there were times when doing nothing was the only thing to do
as he left the officers wardroom he heard someone say wistfully i could do with a bulb of coffee
rosie made the best i ve ever tasted
yes thought the captain grimly she s certainly efficient
whatever job she tackles she ll do it thoroughly
28 dialogue there was only one man aboard galaxy who could regard the situation as anything but a total disaster
i may be about to die rolf van der berg told himself but at least i have a chance of scientific immortality
though that might be poor consolation it was more than anyone else on the ship could hope for
that galaxy was heading for mount zeus he did not doubt for a moment there was nothing else on europa of any significance
indeed there was nothing remotely comparable on any planet
so his theory and he had to admit that it was still a theory was no longer a secret
how could it have leaked out
he trusted uncle paul implicitly but he might have been indiscreet
more likely someone had monitored his computers perhaps as a matter of routine
if so the old scientist could well be in danger rolf wondered if he could or should get a warning to him
he knew that the communications officer was trying to contact ganymede via one of the emergency transmitters an automatic beacon alert had already gone out and the news would be hitting earth any minute now
it had been on its way now for almost an hour come in he said at the quiet knock on his cabin door
oh hello chris
what can i do for you
he was surprised to see second officer chris floyd whom he knew no better than any of his other colleagues
if they landed safely on europa he thought gloomily they might get to know each other far better than they wished
hello doctor
you re the only person who lives around here
i wondered if you could help me
i m not sure how anyone can help anyone at the moment
what s the latest from the bridge
nothing new i ve just left yu and gillings up there trying to fix a mike on the door
but no one inside seems to be talking not surprising chang must have his hands full
can he get us down safely
he s the best if anyone can do it he can
i m more worried about getting off again
god i d not been looking that far ahead
i assumed that was no problem
it could be marginal
remember this ship is designed for orbital operations
we hadn t planned to put down on any major moon though we had hoped to rendezvous with ananke and carme
so we could be stuck on europa especially if chang has to waste propellant looking for a good landing site
do we know where he is trying to land
rolf asked trying not to sound more interested than might be reasonably expected
he must have failed because chris looked at him sharply
there s no way we can tell at this stage though we may get a better idea when he starts braking
but you know these moons where do you think
there s only one interesting place
mount zeus
why should anyone want to land there
roif shrugged
that was one of the things we d hoped to find out
cost us two expensive penetrometers
and it looks like costing a great deal more
haven t you any ideas
you sound like a cop said van der berg with a grin not intending it in the least seriously
funny that s the second time i ve been told that in the last hour
instantly there was a subtle change in the atmosphere of the cabin almost as if the life support system had readjusted itself
oh i was just joking are you
if i was i wouldn t admit it would i
that was no answer thought van der berg but on second thoughts perhaps it was
he looked intently at the young officer noticing not for the first time his striking resemblance to his famous grandfather
someone had mentioned that chris floyd had only joined galaxy on this mission from another ship in the tsung fleet adding sarcastically that it was useful to have good connections in any business
but there had been no criticism of floyd s ability he was an excellent space officer
those skills might qualify him for other part time jobs as well look at rosiemcculien who had also now he came to think of it joined galaxy just before this mission
rolf van der berg felt that he had become enmeshed in some vast and tenuous web of interplanetary intrigue as a scientist accustomed to getting usually straightforward answers to the questions he put to nature he did not enjoy the situation
but he could hardly claim to be an innocent victim
he had tried to conceal the truth or at least what he believed to be the truth
and now the consequences of that deceit had multiplied like the neutrons in a chain reaction with results that might be equally disastrous
which side was chris floyd on
how many sides were there
the bund would certainly be involved once the secret had leaked out
but there were splinter groups within the bund itself and groups opposing them it was like a hall of mirrors
there was one point however on which he did feel reasonably certain
chris floyd if only because of his connections could be trusted
i d put my money thought van der berg on him being assigned to astropol for the duration of the mission however long or short that might now be
i d like to help you chris he said slowly
as you probably suspect i do have some theories
but they may still be utter nonsense
in less than half an hour we may know the truth
until then i prefer to say nothing
and this is not he told himself merely ingrained boer stubbornness
if he had been mistaken he would prefer not to die among men who knew that he was the fool who had brought them to their doom
29 descent second officer chang had been wrestling with the problem ever since galaxy had been successfully to his surprise as much as his relief injected into transfer orbit
for the next couple of hours she was in the hands of god or at least sir isaac newton there was nothing to do but wait until the final braking and descent manoeuvre
he had briefly considered trying to fool rosie by giving the ship a reverse vector at closest approach and so taking it out into space again
it would then be back in a stable orbit and a rescue could eventually be mounted from ganymede
but there was a fundamental objection to this scheme he would certainly not be alive to be rescued
though chang was no coward he would prefer not to become a posthumous hero of the spaceways
in any event his chances of surviving the next hour seemed remote
he had been ordered to take down single handed a three thousand tonner on totally unknown territory
this was not a feat he would care to attempt even on the familiar moon
how many minutes before you start braking
asked rosie
perhaps it was more of an order than a question she clearly understood the fundamentals of astronautics and chang abandoned his last wild fantasies of outwitting her
five he said reluctantly
can i warn the rest of the ship to stand by
i ll do it
give me the mike
this is the bridge
we start braking in five minutes
repeat five minutes
out
to the scientists and officers assembled in the wardroom the message was fully expected
they had had one piece of luck the external video monitors had not been switched off
perhaps rose had forgotten about them it was more likely that she had not bothered
so now as helpless spectators quite literally a captive audience they could watch their unfolding doom
the cloudy crescent of europa now filled the field of the rear view camera
there was no break anywhere in the solid overcast of water vapour recondensing on its way back to nightside
that was not important since the landing would be radar controlled until the last moment
it would however prolong the agony of observers who had to rely on visible light no one stared more intently at the approaching world than the man who had studied it with such frustration for almost a decade
rolf van der berg seated in one of the flimsy low gravity chairs with the restraining belt lightly fastened barely noticed the first onset of weight as braking commenced
in five seconds they were up to full thrust
all the officers were doing rapid calculations on their comsets without access to navigation there would be a lot of guesswork and captain laplace waited for a consensus to emerge
eleven minutes he announced presently assuming he doesn t reduce thrust level he s at max now
and assuming he s going to hover at ten kilometres just above the overcast and then go straight down
that could take another five minutes
it was unnecessary for him to add that the last second of those five minutes would be the most critical
europa seemed determined to keep its secrets to the very end
when galaxy was hovering motionless just above the cloudscape there was still no sign of the land or sea beneath
then for a few agonizing seconds the screens became completely blank except for a glimpse of the now extended and very seldom used landing gear
the noise of its emergence a few minutes earlier had caused a brief flurry of alarm among the passengers now they could only hope that it would perform its duty
how thick is this damn cloud
van der berg asked himself
does it go all the way down no it was breaking thinning out into shreds and wisps and there was the new europa spread out it seemed only a few thousand metres below
it was indeed new one did not have to be a geologist to see that
four billion years ago perhaps the infant earth had looked like this as land and sea prepared to begin their endless conflict
here until fifty years ago there had been neither land nor sea only ice
but now the ice had melted on the lucifer facing hemisphere the resulting water had boiled upwards and been deposited in the permanent deep freeze of nightside
the removal of billions of tons of liquid from one hemisphere to the other had thus exposed ancient seabeds that had never before known even the pale light of the far distant sun
some day perhaps these contorted landscapes would be softened and tamed by a spreading blanket of vegetation now they were barren lava flows and gently steaming mud flats interrupted occasionally by masses of up thrust rock with strangely slanting strata
this had clearly been an area of great tectonic disturbance which was hardly surprising if it had seen the recent birth of a mountain the size of everest
and there it was looming up over the unnaturally close horizon
rolf van der berg felt a tightness in his chest and a tingling of the flesh at the back of his neck
no longer through the remote impersonal senses of instruments but with his own eyes he was seeing the mountain of his dreams
as he well knew it was in the approximate shape of a tetrahedron tilted so that one face was almost vertical
that would be a nice challenge to climbers even in this gravity especially as they couldn t drive pitons into it the summit was hidden in the clouds and much of the gently sloping face turned towards them was covered with snow
is that what all the fuss is about
muttered someone in disgust
looks like a perfectly ordinary mountain to me
i guess that once you ve seen one he was shushed angrily into silence
galaxy was now drifting slowly towards mount zeus as chang searched for a good landing place
the ship had very little lateral control as ninety per cent of the main thrust had to be used merely to support it
there was enough propellant to hover for perhaps five minutes after that he might still be able to land safely but he could never take off again
neil armstrong had faced the same dilemma almost a hundred years ago
but he had not been piloting with a gun aimed at his head
yet for the last few minutes chang had totally forgotten both gun and rosie
every sense was focused on the job ahead he was virtually part of the great machine he was controlling
the only human emotion left to him was not fear but exhilaration
this was the job he had been trained to perform this was the highlight of his professional career even as it might be the finale
and that was what it looked like becoming
the foot of the mountain was now less than a kilometre away and he had still found no landing site
the terrain was incredibly rugged torn with canyons littered with gigantic boulders
he had not seen a single horizontal area larger than a tennis court and the red line on the propellant gauge was only thirty seconds away
but there at last was a smooth surface much the flattest he d seen it was his only chance within the time frame
delicately he juggled the giant unstable cylinder he was controlling towards the patch of horizontal ground it seemed to be snow covered yes it was the blast was blowing the snow away but what s underneath
looks like ice must be a frozen lake how thick
how thick
the five hundred ton hammer blow of galaxy s main jets hit the treacherously inviting surface
a pattern of radiating lines sped swiftly across it the ice cracked and great sheets started to overturn
concentric waves of boiling water hurtled outwards as the fury of the drive blasted into the suddenly uncovered lake
like the well trained officer he was chang reacted automatically without the fatal hesitations of thought
his left hand ripped open the safety lock bar his right grabbed the red lever it protected and pulled it to the open position
the abort program peacefully sleeping ever since galaxy was launched took over and hurled the ship back up into the sky
3 galaxy down in the wardroom the sudden surge of full thrust came like a stay of execution
the horrified officers had seen the collapse of the chosen landing site and knew that there was only one way of escape
now that chang had taken it they once more permitted themselves the luxury of breath
but how long they could continue to enjoy that experience no one could guess
only chang knew whether the ship had enough propellant to reach a stable orbit and even if it did captain laplace thought gloomily the lunatic with the gun might order him down again
though he did not for a minute believe that she really was a lunatic she knew exactly what she was doing
suddenly there was a change in thrust
number four motor s just cut said an engineering officer
i m not surprised probably overheated
not rated for so long at this level
there was of course no sense of any directional change the reduced thrust was still along the ship s axis but the views on the monitor screens had tilted crazily
galaxy was still ascending but no longer vertically
she had become a ballistic missile aimed at some unknown target on europa
once more the thrust dropped abruptly across the video monitors the horizon became level again
he s cut the opposite motor only way to stop us cartwheeling but can he maintain altitude good man
the watching scientists could not see what was good about it the view on the monitors had disappeared completely obscured by a blinding white fog
he s dumping excess propellant lightening the ship the thrust dwindled away to zero the ship was in free fall
in a few seconds it had dropped through the vast cloud of ice crystals created when its dumped propellant had exploded into space
and there beneath it approaching at a leisurely one eighth of a gravity acceleration was europa s central sea
at least chang would not have to select a landing site from now on it would be standard operating procedure familiar as a video game to millions who had never gone into space and never would
all you had to do was to balance the thrust against gravity so that the descending ship reached zero velocity at zero altitude
there was some margin for error but not much even for the water landings which the first american astronauts had preferred and which chang was now reluctantly emulating
if he made a mistake and after the last few hours he could scarcely be blamed no home computer would say to him sorry you ve crashed
would you like to try again
answer yes no second officer yu and his two companions waiting with their improvised weapons outside the locked door of the bridge had perhaps been given the toughest assignment of all
they had no monitor screens to tell them what was happening and had to rely on messages from the wardroom
nor had there been anything through the spy mike which was hardly surprising
chang and mccullen had very little time or need for conversation
the touchdown was superb with hardly a jolt
galaxy sank a few extra metres then bobbed up again to float vertically and thanks to the weight of the engines in the upright position
it was then that the listeners heard the first intelligible sounds through the spy mike
you maniac rosie said chang s voice more in resigned exhaustion than anger
i hope you re satisfied
you ve killed us all
there was one pistol shot then a long silence
yu and his colleagues waited patiently knowing that something was bound to happen soon
then they heard the locking levers being unlatched and gripped the spanners and metal bars they were carrying
she might get one of them but not all the door swung open very slowly
sorry said second officer chang
i must have passed out for a minute
then like any reasonable man he fainted again
31 the sea of galilee i can never understand how a man could become a doctor captain laplace told himself
or an undertaker for that matter
they have some nasty jobs to do well did you find anything
no skipper
of course i don t have the right sort of equipment
there are some implants that you could only locate through a microscope or so i m told
they could only be very short range though
perhaps to a relay transmitter somewhere in the ship floyd s suggested we make a search
you took fingerprints and any other idents
yes when we contact ganymede we ll beam them up with her papers
but i doubt if we ll ever know who rosie was or who she was acting for
or why for god s sake
at least she showed some human instincts said laplace thoughtfully
she must have known she d failed when chang pulled the abort lever
she could have shot him then instead of letting him land
much good that will do us i m afraid
let me tell you something that happened when jenkins and i put the cadaver out through the refuse dump
the doctor pursed his lips in a grimace of distaste
you were right of course it was the only thing to do
well we didn t bother to attach any weights it floated for a few minutes we watched to see if it would clear the ship and then the doctor seemed to be struggling for words
what dammit
something came up out of the water like a parrot beak but about a hundred times bigger
it took rosie with one snap and disappeared
we have some impressive company here even if we could breathe outside i certainly wouldn t recommend swimming bridge to captain said the officer on duty big disturbance in the water camera three i ll give you the picture
that s the thing i saw
cried the doctor
he felt a sudden chill at the inevitable ominous thought i hope it s not back for more
suddenly a vast bulk broke through the surface of the ocean and arched into the sky
for a moment the whole monstrous shape was suspended between air and water
the familiar can be as shocking as the strange when it is in the wrong place
both captain and doctor exclaimed simultaneously it s a shark
there was just time to notice a few subtle differences in addition to the monstrous parrot beak before the giant crashed back into the sea
there was an extra pair of fins and there appeared to be no gills
nor were there any eyes but on either side of the beak there were curious protuberances that might be some other sense organs
convergent evolution of course said the doctor
same problems same solutions on any planet
look at earth
sharks dolphins ichthyosaurs all oceanic predators must have the same basic design
that beak puzzles me though what s it doing now
the creature had surfaced again but now it was moving very slowly as if exhausted after that one gigantic leap
in fact it seemed to be in trouble even in agony it was beating its tail against the sea without attempting to move in any definite direction
suddenly it vomited its last meal turned belly up and lay wallowing lifelessly in the gentle swell
oh my god whispered the captain his voice full of revulsion
i think i know what s happened
totally alien biochemistries said the doctor even he seemed shaken by the sight
rosie s claimed one victim after all
the sea of galilee was of course named after the man who had discovered europa as he in turn had been named after a much smaller sea on another world
it was a very young sea being less than fifty years old and like most new born infants could be quite boisterous
although the europan atmosphere was still too thin to generate real hurricanes a steady wind blew from the surrounding land towards the tropical zone at the point above which lucifer was stationary
here at the point of perpetual noon the water was continually boiling though at a temperature in this thin atmosphere barely hot enough to make a good cup of tea
luckily the steamy turbulent region immediately beneath lucifer was a thousand kilometres away galaxy had descended in a relatively calm area less than a hundred kilometres from the nearest land
at peak velocity she could cover that distance in a fraction of a second but now as she drifted beneath the low hanging clouds of europa s permanent overcast land seemed as far off as the remotest quasar
to make matters worse if possible the eternal off shore wind was taking her further out to sea
and even if she could manage to ground herself on some virgin beach of this new world she might be no better off than she was now
but she would be more comfortable spaceships though admirably watertight are seldom seaworthy
galaxy was floating in a vertical position bobbing up and down with gentle but disturbing oscillations half the crew was already sick
captain laplace s first action after he had been through the damage reports was to appeal for anyone with experience in handling boats of any size or shape
it seemed reasonable to suppose that among thirty astronautical engineers and space scientists there should be a considerable amount of seafaring talent and he immediately located five amateur sailors and even one professional purser frank lee who had started his career with the tsung shipping lines and then switched to space
although pursers were more accustomed to handling accounting machines often in frank lee s case a two hundred year old ivory abacus than navigational instruments they still had to pass exams in basic seamanship
lee had never had a chance of testing his maritime skills now almost a billion kilometres from the south china sea his time had come
we should flood the propellant tanks he told the captain
then we ll ride lower and won t be bobbing up and down so badly
it seemed foolish to let even more water into the ship and the captain hesitated
suppose we run aground
no one made the obvious comment what difference will it make
without any serious discussion it had been assumed that they would be better off on land if they could ever reach it
we can always blow the tanks again
we ll have to do that anyway when we reach shore to get the ship into a horizontal position
thank god we have power his voice trailed off everyone knew what he meant
without the auxiliary reactor which was now running the life support systems they would all be dead within hours
now barring a breakdown the ship could sustain them indefinitely
ultimately of course they would starve they had just had dramatic proof that there was no nourishment but only poison in the seas of europa
at least they had made contact with ganymede so that the entire human race now knew their predicament
the best brains in the solar system would now be trying to save them
if they failed the passengers and crew of galaxy would have the consolation of dying in the full glare of publicity
iv at the water hole 32 diversion the latest news said captain smith to his assembled passengers is that galaxy is afloat and in fairly good condition
one crew member a woman steward has been killed we don t know the details but everyone else is safe
the ship s systems are all working there are a few leaks but they ve been controlled
captain laplace says there s no immediate danger but the prevailing wind is driving them further away from the mainland towards the centre of dayside
that s not a serious problem there are several large islands they re virtually certain to reach first
at the moment they re ninety kilometres from the nearest land
they ve seen some large marine animals but they show no sign of hostility
barring further accidents they should be able to survive for several months until they run out of food which of course is now being strictly rationed
but according to captain laplace morale is still high
now this is where we come in
if we return to earth immediately get refuelled and refitted we can reach europa in a retrograde powered orbit in eighty five days
universe is the only ship currently commissioned that can land there and take off again with a reasonable payload
the ganymede shuttles may be able to drop supplies but that s all though it may make the difference between life and death
i m sorry ladies and gentlemen that our visit has been cut short but i think you ll agree that we ve shown you everything we promised
and i m sure you ll approve of our new mission even though the chances of success are frankly rather slim
that s all for the moment
dr floyd can i have a word with you
as the others drifted slowly and thoughtfully from the main lounge scene of so many less portentous briefings the captain scanned a clipboard full of messages
there were still occasions when words printed on pieces of paper were the most convenient medium of communication but even here technology had made its mark
the sheets that the captain was reading were made of the indefinitely reusable multifax material which had done so much to reduce the load on the humble wastepaper basket
heywood he said now that the formalities were over as you can guess the circuits are burning up
and there s a lot going on that i don t understand
ditto answered floyd
anything from chris yet
no but ganymede s relayed your message he should have had it by now
there s a priority override on private communications as you can imagine but of course your name overrode that
thanks skipper
anything i can do to help
not really i ll let you know
it was almost the last time for quite a while that they would be on speaking terms with each other
within a few hours dr heywood floyd would become that crazy old fool
and the short lived mutiny on the universe would have begun led by the captain
it was not actually heywood floyd s idea he only wished it was
second officer roy jolson was stars the navigation officer floyd barely knew him by sight and had never had occasion to say more than good morning to him
he was quite surprised therefore by the diffident knock on his cabin door
the astrogator was carrying a set of charts and seemed a little ill at ease
he could not be overawed by floyd s presence everyone on board now took him for granted so there must be some other reason
dr floyd he began in a tone of such urgent anxiety that he reminded his listener of a salesman whose entire future depends on making the next deal
i d like your advice and assistance
of course but what can i do
jolson unrolled the chart showing the position of all the planets inside the orbit of lucifer
your old trick of coupling leonov and discovery to escape from jupiter before it blew up gave me the idea
it wasn t mine
walter curnow thought of it
oh i never knew that
of course we don t have another ship to boost us here but we have something much better
what do you mean
asked floyd completely baffled
don t laugh
why go back to earth to take on propellant when old faithful is blasting out tons every second a couple of hundred metres away
if we tapped that we could get to europa not in three months but in three weeks
the concept was so obvious yet so daring that it took floyd s breath away
he could see half a dozen objections instantly but none of them seemed fatal
what does the captain think of the idea
i ve not told him that s why i need your help
i d like you to check my calculations then put the idea to him
he d turn me down i m quite certain and i don t blame him
if i was captain i think i would too there was a long silence in the little cabin
then heywood floyd said slowly let me give you all the reasons why it can t be done
then you can tell me why i m wrong
second officer jolson knew his commander captain smith had never heard such a crazy suggestion in his life
his objections were all well founded and showed little if any trace of the notorious not invented here syndrome
oh it would work in theory he admitted
but think of the practical problems man
how would you get the stuff into the tanks
i ve talked to the engineers
we d move the ship to the edge of the crater it s quite safe to get within fifty metres
there s plumbing in the unfurnished section we can rip out then we d run a line to old faithful and wait until he spouts you know how reliable and well behaved he is
but our pumps can t operate in a near vacuum
we don t need them we can rely on the geyser s own efflux velocity to give us an input of at least a hundred kilos a second
old faithful will do all the work
he ll just give ice crystals and steam not liquid water
it will condense when it gets on board
you ve really thought this out haven t you
said the captain with grudging admiration
but i just don t believe it
is the water pure enough for one thing
what about contaminants especially carbon particles
floyd could not help smiling
captain smith was developing an obsession about soot we can filter out large ones the rest won t affect the reaction
oh yes the hydrogen isotope ratio here looks better than for earth
you may even get some extra thrust
what do your colleagues think of the idea
if we head straight for lucifer it may be months before they can get home i ve not spoken to them
but does it matter when so many lives are at stake
we may reach galaxy seventy days ahead of schedule
seventy days
think what could happen on europa in that time
i m perfectly aware of the time factor snapped the captain
that applies to us as well
we may not have provisions for such an extended trip
now he s straining at gnats thought floyd and he must know that i know it
better be tactful an extra couple of weeks
i can t believe we have so narrow a margin
you ve been feeding us too well anyway
do some of us good to be on short rations for a while
the captain managed a frosty smile
you can tell that to willis and mihailovich
but i m afraid the whole idea is insane
at least let us try it on the owners
i d like to speak to sir lawrence
i can t stop you of course said captain smith in a tone that suggested he wished he could
but i know exactly what he ll say
he was quite wrong
sir lawrence tsung had not placed a bet for thirty years it was no longer in keeping with his august position in the world of commerce
but as a young man he had often enjoyed a mild flutter at the hong kong race course before a puritanical administration had closed it in a fit of public morality
it was typical of life sir lawrence sometimes thought wistfully that when he could bet he had no money and now he couldn t because the richest man in the world had to set a good example
and yet as nobody knew better than he did his whole business career had been one long gamble
he had done his utmost to control the odds by gathering the best information and listening to the experts his hunches told him would give the wisest advice
he had usually pulled out in time when they were wrong but there had always been an element of risk
now as he read the memorandum from heywood floyd he felt again the old thrill he had not known since he had watched the horses thundering round into the last lap
here was a gamble indeed perhaps the last and greatest of his career though he would never dare tell his board of directors
still less the lady jasmine
bill he said what do you think
his son steady and reliable but lacking that vital spark which was perhaps no longer needed in this generation gave him the answer he expected
the theory is quite sound
universe can do it on paper
but we ve lost one ship
we ll be risking another
she s going to jupiter lucifer anyway
yes but after a complete checkout in earth orbit
and do you realize what this proposed direct mission will involve
she ll be smashing all speed records doing over a thousand kilometres a second at turnaround
it was the worst thing he could possibly have said once again the thunder of hooves sounded in his father s ears
but sir lawrence merely answered it won t do any harm for them to make some tests though captain smith is fighting the idea tooth and nail
even threatens to resign
meanwhile just check the position with lloyd s we may have to back down on the galaxy claim
especially he might have added if we re going to throw universe on to the table as an even bigger chip
and he was worried about captain smith
now that laplace was stranded on europa he was the best commander he had left
33 pit stop sloppiest job i ve seen since i left college grumbled the chief engineer
but it s the best we can do in the time
the makeshift pipeline stretched across fifty metres of dazzling chemical encrusted rock to the now quiescent vent of old faithful where it ended in a rectangular downward pointing funnel
the sun had just risen over the hills and already the ground had begun to tremble slightly as the geyser s subterranean or subhallean reservoirs felt the first touch of warmth
watching from the observation lounge heywood floyd could hardly believe that so much had happened in a mere twenty four hours
first of all the ship had split into two rival factions one led by the captain the other perforce headed by himself
they had been coldly polite to each other and there had been no actual exchange of blows but he had discovered that in certain quarters he now rejoiced in the nickname of suicide floyd
it was not an honour that he particularly appreciated
yet no one could find anything fundamentally wrong with the floyd jolson manoeuvre
that name was also unfair he had insisted that jolson get all the credit but no one had listened
and mihailovich had said aren t you prepared to share the blame
the first test would be in twenty minutes when old faithful rather belatedly greeted the dawn
but even if that worked and the propellant tanks started to fill with sparkling pure water rather than the muddy slurry captain smith had predicted the road to europa was still not open
a minor but not unimportant factor was the wishes of the distinguished passengers
they had expected to be home within two weeks now to their surprise and in some cases consternation they were faced with the prospect of a dangerous mission halfway across the solar system and even if it succeeded no firm date for a return to earth
willis was distraught all his schedules would be totally wrecked
he drifted around muttering about lawsuits but no one expressed the slightest sympathy
greenburg on the other hand was ecstatic now he would really be in the space business again
and mihailovich who spent a lot of time noisily composing in his far from soundproof cabin was almost equally delighted
he was sure that the diversion would inspire him to new heights of creativity
maggie m was philosophical if it can save a lot of lives she said looking pointedly at willis how can anyone possibly object
as for yva merlin floyd made a special effort to explain matters to her and discovered that she understood the situation remarkably well
and it was yva to his utter astonishment who asked the question to which no one else seemed to have paid much attention suppose the europans don t want us to land even to rescue our friends
floyd looked at her in frank amazement even now he still found it difficult to accept her as a real human being and never knew when she would come out with some brilliant insight or utter stupidity
that s a very good question yva
believe me i m working on it
he was telling the truth he could never lie to yva merlin
that somehow would be an act of sacrilege
the first wisps of vapour were appearing over the mouth of the geyser
they shot upwards and away in their unnatural vacuum trajectories and evaporated swiftly in the fierce sunlight
old faithful coughed again and cleared its throat
a snowy white and surprisingly compact column of ice crystals and water droplets climbed swiftly towards the sky
all one s terrestrial instincts expected it to topple and fall but of course it did not
it continued onwards and upwards spreading only slightly until it merged into the vast glowing envelope of the comet s still expanding coma
floyd noted with satisfaction that the pipeline was beginning to shake as fluid rushed into it
ten minutes later there was a council of war on the bridge
captain smith still in a huff acknowledged floyd s presence with a slight nod his number two a little embarrassed did all the talking
well it works surprisingly well
at this rate we can fill our tanks in twenty hours though we may have to go out and anchor the pipe more securely
what about the dirt
someone asked
the first officer held up a transparent squeeze bulb holding a colourless liquid
the filters got rid of everything down to a few microns to be on the safe side we ll run through them twice cycling from one tank to another
no swimming pool i m afraid until we pass mars
that got a much needed laugh and even the captain relaxed a little
we ll run up the engines at minimum thrust to check that there are no operational anomalies with halley h2
if there are we ll forget the whole idea and head home on good old moon water fob aristarchus
there was one of those party silences where everyone waits simultaneously for someone else to speak
then captain smith broke the embarrassing hiatus
as you all know he said i m very unhappy with the whole idea
in fact he changed course abruptly it was equally well known that he had considered sending sir lawrence his resignation though in the circumstances that would have been a somewhat pointless gesture
but a couple of things have happened in the last few hours
the owner agrees with the project if no fundamental objections emerge from our tests
and this is the big surprise and i don t know any more about it than you do the world space council has not only okayed but requested that we make the diversion underwriting any expenses incurred
your guess is as good as mine but i still have one worry he looked doubtfully at the little bulb of water which heywood floyd was now holding up to the light and shaking gently
i m an engineer not a damn chemist
this stuff looks clean but what will it do to the tank linings
floyd never quite understood why he acted as he did such rashness was completely uncharacteristic
perhaps he was simply impatient with the whole debate and wanted to get on with the job
or perhaps he felt that the captain needed a little stiffening of the moral fibre
with one quick movement he flicked open the stopcock and squirted approximately 2 cc of halley s comet down his throat
there s your answer captain he said when he had finished swallowing
and that said the ship s doctor half an hour later was one of the silliest exhibitions i ve ever seen
don t you know that there are cyanides and cyanogens and god knows what else in that stuff
of course i do laughed floyd
i ve seen the analyses just a few parts in a million
nothing to worry about but i did have one surprise he added ruefully
and what was that
if you could ship this stuff back to earth you could make a fortune selling it as halley s patent purgative
34 car wash now that they were committed the whole atmosphere aboard universe had changed
there was no more argument everyone was cooperating to the utmost and very few people had much sleep for the next two rotations of the nucleus a hundred hours of earth time
the first halley day was devoted to a still rather cautious tapping of old faithful but when the geyser subsided towards nightfall the technique had been thoroughly mastered
more than a thousand tons of water had been taken aboard the next period of daylight would be ample for the rest
heywood floyd kept out of the captain s way not wishing to press his luck in any event smith had a thousand details to attend to
but the calculation of the new orbit was not among them that had been checked and rechecked on earth
there was no doubt now that the concept was brilliant and the savings even greater than jolson had claimed
by refuelling on halley universe had eliminated the two major orbit changes involved in the rendezvous with earth she could now go straight to her goal under maximum acceleration saving many weeks
despite the possible risks everyone now applauded the scheme
well almost everyone
on earth the swiftly organized hands off halley
society was indignant
its members a mere 236 but they knew how to drum up publicity did not consider the rifling of a celestial body justified even to save lives
they refused to be placated even when it was pointed out that universe was merely borrowing material that the comet was about to lose anyway
it was they argued the principle of the thing
their angry communiqu s gave much needed light relief aboard universe
cautious as ever captain smith ran the first low powered tests with one of the attitude control thrusters if this became unserviceable the ship could manage without it there were no anomalies the engine behaved exactly as if it was running on the best distilled water from the lunar mines
then he tested the central main engine number one if that was damaged there would be no loss of manoeuvrability only of total thrust
the ship would still be fully controllable but with the four remaining outboards alone peak acceleration would be down by twenty per cent
again there were no problems even the sceptics started being polite to heywood floyd and second officer jolson was no longer a social outcast
the lift off was scheduled late in the afternoon just before old faithful was due to subside
would it still be there to greet the next visitors in seventy six years time
floyd wondered
perhaps there were hints of its existence even back on the 191 photographs
there was no countdown in the dramatic oldtime cape canaveral style
when he was quite satisfied that everything was shipshape captain smith applied a mere five tons of thrust on number one and universe drifted slowly upwards and away from the comet
the acceleration was modest but the pyrotechnics were awe inspiring and to most of the watchers wholly unexpected
until now the jets from the main engines had been virtually invisible being formed entirely of highly ionized oxygen and hydrogen
even when hundreds of kilometres away the gases had cooled off enough to combine chemically there was still nothing to be seen because the reaction gave no light in the visible spectrum
but now universe was climbing away from halley on a column of incandescence too brilliant for the eye to look upon it seemed almost a solid pillar of flame
where it hit the ground rock exploded upwards and outwards as it departed for ever universe was carving its signature like cosmic graffiti across the nucleus of halley s comet
most of the passengers accustomed to climbing spacewards with no visible means of support reacted with considerable shock
floyd waited for the inevitable explanation one of his minor pleasures was catching willis in some scientific error but this very seldom happened
and even when it did willis always had some very plausible excuse
carbon he said
incandescent carbon exactly as in a candle flame but slightly hotter
slightly murmured floyd
we re no longer burning if you ll excuse the word floyd shrugged his shoulders pure water
although it s been carefully filtered there s a lot of colloidal carbon in it
as well as compounds that could only be removed by distillation
it s very impressive but i m a little worried said greenburg
all that radiation won t it affect the engines and heat the ship badly
it was a very good question and it had caused some anxiety
floyd waited for willis to handle it but that shrewd operator bounced the ball right back to him
i d prefer dr floyd to deal with that after all it was his idea
jolson s please
good point though
but it s no real problem when we re under full thrust all those fireworks will be a thousand kilometres behind us
we won t have to worry about them
the ship was now hovering some two kilometres above the nucleus had it not been for the glare of the exhaust the whole sunlit face of the tiny world would have been spread out beneath
at this altitude or distance the column of old faithful had broadened slightly
it looked floyd suddenly recalled like one of the giant fountains ornamenting lake geneva
he had not seen them for fifty years and wondered if they still played there
captain smith was testing the controls slowly rotating the ship then pitching and yawing it along the y and z axes
everything seemed to be functioning perfectly
mission time zero is ten minutes from now he announced
1 gee for fifty hours then 2 until turnaround one hundred and fifty hours from now
he paused to let that sink in no other ship had ever attempted to maintain so high a continuous acceleration for so long
if universe was not able to brake properly she would also enter the history books as the first manned interstellar voyager
the ship was now turning towards the horizontal if that word could be used in this almost gravityless environment and was pointing directly to the white column of mist and ice crystals still steadily spurting from the comet
universe started to move towards it what s he doing
said mihailovich anxiously
obviously anticipating such questions the captain spoke again
he seemed to have completely recovered his good humour and there was a hint of amusement in his voice
just one little chore before we leave don t worry i know exactly what i m doing
and number two agrees with me don t you
yessir though i thought you were joking at first
what is going on up on the bridge
asked willis for once at a loss
now the ship was starting a slow roll while still moving at no more than a good walking speed towards the geyser
from this distance now less than a hundred metres it reminded floyd still more closely of those far off geneva fountains
surely he s not taking us into it but he was
universe vibrated gently as it nuzzled its way into the rising column of foam
it was still rolling very slowly as if it was drilling its way into the giant geyser
the video monitors and observation windows showed only a milky blankness
the whole operation could not have lasted more than ten seconds then they were out on the other side
there was a brief burst of spontaneous clapping from the officers on the bridge but the passengers even including floyd still felt somewhat put upon
now we re ready to go said the captain in tones of great satisfaction
we have a nice clean ship again
during the next half hour more than ten thousand amateur observers on earth and moon reported that the comet had doubled its brightness
the comet watch network broke down completely under the overload and the professional astronomers were furious
but the public loved it and a few days later universe put on an even better show a few hours before dawn
the ship gaining speed by more than ten thousand kilometres an hour every hour was now far inside the orbit of venus
it would get even closer to the sun before it made its perihelion passage far more swiftly than any natural celestial body and headed out towards lucifer
as it passed between earth and sun the thousand kilometre tail of incandescent carbon was easily visible as a fourth magnitude star showing appreciable movement against the constellations of the morning sky in the course of a single hour
at the very beginning of its rescue mission universe would be seen by more human beings at the same moment than any artefact in the history of the world
35 adrift the unexpected news that their sister ship universe was on the way and might arrive far sooner than anyone had dared to dream had an effect upon the morale of galaxy s crew that could only be called euphoric
the mere fact that they were drifting helplessly on a strange ocean surrounded by unknown monsters suddenly seemed of minor importance
as did the monsters themselves though they made interesting appearances from time to time
the giant sharks were sighted occasionally but never came near the ship even when garbage was dumped overboard
this was quite surprising it strongly suggested that the great beasts unlike their terrestrial counterparts had a good system of communication
perhaps they were more closely allied to dolphins than to sharks
there were many schools of smaller fish which no one would have given a second glance in a market on earth
after several attempts one of the officers a keen angler managed to catch one with an unbaited hook
he never brought it in through the airlock the captain would not have permitted it anyway but measured and photographed it carefully before returning it to the sea
the proud sportsman had to pay a price for his trophy however
the partial pressure spacesuit he had worn during the exercise had the characteristic rotten eggs stink of hydrogen sulphide when he brought it back into the ship and he became the butt of innumerable jokes
it was yet another reminder of an alien and implacably hostile biochemistry
despite the pleas of the scientists no further angling was allowed
they could watch and record but not collect and anyway it was pointed out they were planetary geologists not naturalists
no one had thought of bringing formalin which probably would not work here in any event
once the ship drifted for several hours through floating mats or sheets of some bright green material
it formed ovals about ten metres across and all of approximately the same size galaxy ploughed through them without resistance and they swiftly reformed behind her
it was guessed that they were colonial organisms of some kind
and one morning the officer of the watch was startled when a periscope rose out of the water and he found himself staring into a mild blue eye which he said when he had recovered looked like a sick cow s
it regarded him sadly for a few moments without much apparent interest then slowly returned to the ocean nothing seemed to move very fast here and the reason was obvious
this was still a low energy world there was none of the free oxygen that allowed the animals of earth to live by a series of continuous explosions from the moment they started to breathe at birth
only the shark of that first encounter had shown any sign of violent activity in its last dying spasm
perhaps that was good news for men
even if they were encumbered with spacesuits there was probably nothing on europa that could catch them even if it wanted to
captain laplace found wry amusement in handing over the operation of his ship to the purser he wondered if this situation was unique in the annals of space and sea
not that there was a great deal that mr lee could do
galaxy was floating vertically one third out of the water heeling slightly before a wind that was driving it at a steady five knots
there were only a few leaks below the waterline easily handled
equally important the hull was still airtight
although most of the navigation equipment was useless they knew exactly where they were
ganymede gave them an accurate fix on their emergency beacon every hour and if galaxy kept to her present course she would make landfall on a large island within the next three days
if she missed that she would head on out to the open sea and eventually reach the tepidly boiling zone immediately underneath lucifer
though not necessarily catastrophic that was a most unattractive prospect acting captain lee spent much of his time thinking of ways to avoid it
sails even if he had suitable material and rigging would make very little difference to their course
he had lowered improvised sea anchors down to five hundred metres looking for currents that might be useful and finding none
nor had he found the bottom it lay unknown kilometres further down
perhaps that was just as well it protected them from the submarine quakes that continually
racked this new ocean
sometimes galaxy would shake as if struck by a giant hammer as a shockwave went racing by
in a few hours a tsunami dozens of metres high would crash upon some europan shore but here in deep water the deadly waves were little more than ripples
several times sudden vortexes were observed at a distance they looked quite dangerous maelstroms that might even suck galaxy down to unknown depths but luckily they were too far off to do more than make the ship spin around a few times in the water
and just once a huge bubble of gas rose and burst only a hundred metres away
it was most impressive and everyone seconded the doctor s heartfelt comment thank god we can t smell it
it is surprising how quickly the most bizarre situation can become routine
within a few days life aboard galaxy had settled down to a steady routine and captain laplace s main problem was keeping the crew occupied
there was nothing worse for morale than idleness and he wondered how the skippers of the old windjammers had kept their men busy on those interminable voyages
they couldn t have spent all their time scrambling up the rigging or cleaning the decks
he had the opposite problem with the scientists
they were always proposing tests and experiments which had to be carefully considered before they could be approved
and if he allowed it they would have monopolized the ship s now very limited communications channels
the main antenna complex was now being battered around at the waterline and galaxy could no longer talk directly to earth
everything had to be relayed through ganymede on a bandwidth of a few miserable megahertz
a single live video channel pre empted everything else and he had to resist the clamour of the terrestrial networks
not that they would have a great deal to show their audiences except open sea cramped ship interiors and a crew which though in good spirits was becoming steadily more hirsute
an unusual amount of traffic seemed directed to second officer floyd whose encrypted responses were so brief that they could not have contained much information
laplace finally decided to have a talk to the young man
mr floyd he said in the privacy of his cabin
i d appreciate it if you would enlighten me about your part time occupation
floyd looked embarrassed and clutched at the table as the ship rocked slightly in a sudden gust
i wish i could sir but i m not permitted
by whom may i ask
frankly i m not sure
that was perfectly true
he suspected it was astropol but the two quietly impressive gentlemen who had briefed him on ganymede had unaccountably failed to provide this information
as captain of this ship especially in the present circumstances i would like to know what s going on here
if we get out of this i m going to spend the next few years of my life at courts of enquiry
and you ll probably be doing the same
floyd managed a wry grin
hardly worth being rescued is it sir
all i know is that some high level agency expected trouble on this mission but didn t know what form it would take
i was just told to keep my eyes open
i m afraid i didn t do much good but i imagine i was the only qualified person they could get hold of in time
i don t think you can blame yourself
who would have imagined that rosie the captain paused struck by a sudden thought
do you suspect anyone else
he felt like adding me for instance
but the situation was already sufficiently paranoiac
floyd looked thoughtful then apparently came to a decision
perhaps i should have spoken to you before sir but i know how busy you ve been
i m sure dr van der berg is involved somehow
he s a mede of course they re odd people and i don t really understand them
or like them he might have added
too clannish not really friendly to offworlders
still one could hardly blame them all pioneers trying to tame a new wilderness were probably much the same
van der berg hmm
what about the other scientists
they ve been checked of course
all perfectly legitimate and nothing unusual about any of them
that was not altogether true
dr simpson had more wives than was strictly legal at least at one time and dr higgins had a large collection of most curious books
second officer floyd was not quite sure why he had been told all this perhaps his mentors merely wanted to impress him with their omniscience
he decided that working for astropol or whoever it was had some entertaining fringe benefits
very well said the captain dismissing the amateur agent
but please keep me informed if you discover anything anything at all that might affect the safety of the ship
in the present circumstances it was hard to imagine what that might be
any further hazards seemed slightly superfluous
36 the alien shore even twenty four hours before they sighted the island it was still not certain whether galaxy would miss it and be blown on out into the emptiness of the central ocean
her position as observed by the ganymede radar was plotted on a large chart which everyone aboard examined anxiously several times a day
even if the ship did reach land her problems might be just beginning
she might be pounded to pieces on a rocky coast rather than gently deposited on some conveniently shelving beach
acting captain lee was keenly aware of all these possibilities
he had once been shipwrecked himself in a cabin cruiser whose engines had failed at a critical moment off the island of bali
there had been little danger though a good deal of drama and he had no wish to repeat the experience especially as there was no coastguard here to come to the rescue
there was a truly cosmic irony in their plight
here they were aboard one of the most advanced transportation devices ever made by man capable of crossing the solar system
yet now they could not deflect it more than a few metres from its course
nevertheless they were not completely helpless lee still had a few cards to play
on this sharply curving world the island was only five kilometres away when they first sighted it
to lee s great relief there were none of the cliffs he had feared nor on the other hand was there any sign of the beach he had hoped for
the geologists had warned him that he was a few million years too early to find sand here the mills of europa grinding slowly had not yet had time to do their work
as soon as it was certain they would hit the land lee gave orders to pump out galaxy s main tanks which he had deliberately flooded soon after touchdown
then followed a very uncomfortable few hours during which at least a quarter of the crew took no further interest in the proceedings
galaxy rose higher and higher in the water oscillating more and more wildly then tumbled with a mighty splash to lie along the surface like the corpse of a whale in the bad old days when the catcher boats pumped them full of air to stop them sinking
when he saw how the ship was lying lee adjusted her buoyancy again until she was slightly stern down and the forward bridge was just clear of the water
as he expected galaxy then swung broadside on to the wind
another quarter of the crew became incapacitated then but lee had enough helpers to get out the sea anchor he had prepared for this final act
it was merely an improvised raft made of empty boxes lashed together but its drag caused the ship to point towards the approaching land
now they could see that they were heading with agonizing slowness towards a narrow stretch of beach covered with small boulders
if they could not have sand this was the best alternative
the bridge was already over the beach when galaxy grounded and lee played his last card
he had made only a single test run not daring to do more in case the abused machinery failed
for the last time galaxy extended her landing gear
there was a grinding and shuddering as the pads on the underside dug their way into the alien beach
now she was securely anchored against the winds and waves of this tideless ocean
there was no doubt that galaxy had found her final resting place and all too possibly that of her crew
v through the asteroids 37 star and now universe was moving so swiftly that its orbit no longer even remotely resembled that of any natural object in the solar system
mercury closest to the sun barely exceeds fifty kilometres a second at perihelion universe had reached twice that speed in the first day and at only half the acceleration it would achieve when it was lighter by several thousand tons of water
for a few hours as they passed inside its orbit venus was the brightest of all heavenly bodies next to the sun and lucifer
its tiny disc was just visible to the naked eye but even the ship s most powerful telescopes showed no markings whatever
venus guarded her secrets as jealously as europa
by going still closer to the sun well inside the orbit of mercury universe was not merely taking a short cut but was also getting a free boost from the sun s gravitational field
because nature always balances her books the sun lost some velocity in the transaction but the effect would not be measurable for a few thousand years
captain smith used the ship s perihelion passage to restore some of the prestige his foot dragging had cost him
now you know he said exactly why i flew the ship through old faithful
if we hadn t washed all that dirt off the hull by this time we d be badly overheating
in fact i doubt if the thermal controls would have handled the load it s already ten times earth level
looking through filters that were almost black at the hideously swollen sun his passengers could easily believe him
they were all more than happy when it had shrunk back to normal size and continued to dwindle astern as universe sliced across the orbit of mars outward bound on the final leg of its mission
the famous five had all adjusted in their various ways to the unexpected change in their lives
mihailovich was composing copiously and noisily and was seldom seen except when he emerged at meals to tell outrageous stories and tease all available victims especially willis
greenburg had elected himself no one dissenting an honorary crew member and spent much of his time on the bridge
maggie m viewed the situation with rueful amusement
writers she remarked are always saying what a lot of work they could do if they were only in some place with no interruptions no engagements lighthouses and prisons are their favourite examples
so i can t complain except that my requests for research material keep getting delayed by high priority messages
even victor willis had now come to much the same conclusion he too was busily at work on sundry long range projects
and he had an additional reason to keep to his cabin
it would still be several weeks before he looked as if he had forgotten to shave and months before he returned to his full glory
yva merlin spent hours every day in the entertainment centre catching up as she readily explained with her favourite classics
it was fortunate that universe s library and projection facilities had been installed in time for the voyage though the collection was still relatively small there was sufficient for several lifetimes of viewing
all the famous works of visual art were there right back to the flickering dawn of the cinema
yva knew most of them and was happy to share her knowledge
floyd of course enjoyed listening to her because then she became alive an ordinary human being not an icon
he found it both sad and fascinating that only through an artificial universe of video images could she establish contact with the real world
one of the strangest experiences of heywood floyd s fairly eventful life was sitting in semi darkness just behind yva somewhere outside the orbit of mars while they watched the original gone with the wind together
there were moments when he could see her famous profile silhouetted against that of vivien leigh and could compare the two though it was impossible to say that one actress was better than the other both were sui generis
when the lights went up he was astonished to see that yva was crying
he took her hand and said tenderly i cried too when bonny died
yva managed a faint smile
i was really crying for vivien she said
while we were shooting two i read a lot about her she had such a tragic life
and talking about her right out here between the planets reminds me of something that larry said when he brought the poor thing back from ceylon after her nervous breakdown
he told his friends i ve married a woman from outer space
yva paused for a moment and another tear trickled rather theatrically floyd could not help thinking down her cheek
and here s something even stranger
she made her last movie exactly a hundred years ago and do you know what it was
go on surprise me again
i expect it will surprise maggie if she s really writing the book she keeps threatening us with
vivien s very last film was ship of fools
38 icebergs of space now that they had so much unexpected time on their hands captain smith had finally agreed to give victor willis the long delayed interview which was part of his contract
victor himself had kept putting it off owing to what mihailovich persisted in calling his amputation
as it would be many months before he could regenerate his public image he had finally decided to do the interview off camera the studio on earth could fake him in later with library shots
they had been sitting in the captain s still only partly furnished cabin enjoying one of the excellent wines which apparently made up much of victor s baggage allowance
as universe would cut its drive and start coasting within the next few hours this would be the last opportunity for several days
weightless wine victor maintained was an abomination he refused to put any of his precious vintage into plastic squeezebulbs
this is victor willis aboard the spaceship universe at 18 3 on friday 15 july 2 61
though we re not yet at the mid point of our journey we re already far beyond the orbit of mars and have almost reached our maximum velocity
which is captain
one thousand and fifty kilometres a second
more than a thousand kilometres a second almost four million kilometres an hour
victor willis surprise sounded perfectly genuine no one would have guessed that he knew the orbital parameters almost as well as did the captain
but one of his strengths was his ability to put himself in the place of his viewers and not only to anticipate their questions but to arouse their interest
that s right the captain answered with quiet pride
we are travelling twice as fast as any human beings since the beginning of time
that should have been one of my lines thought victor he did not like his subject to get ahead of him
but good professional that he was he quickly adapted
he pretended to consult his famous little memo pad with its sharply directional screen whose display only he could see
every twelve seconds we re travelling the diameter of earth
yet it will still take us another ten days to reach jupi ah lucifer
that gives some idea of the scale of the solar system
now captain this is a delicate subject but i ve had a lot of questions about it during the last week
oh no groaned smith
not the zero gravity toilets again
at this very moment we are passing right through the heart of the asteroid belt i wish it was the toilets thought smith and though no spaceship has ever been seriously damaged by a collision aren t we taking quite a risk
after all there are literally millions of bodies down to the size of beachballs orbiting in this section of space
and only a few thousand have been charted
more than a few over ten thousand
but there are millions we don t know about
that s true but it wouldn t help us much if we did
what do you mean
there s nothing we can do about them
why not
captain smith paused for careful thought
willis was right this was indeed a delicate subject head office would rap his knuckles smartly if he said anything to discourage potential customers
first of all space is so enormous that even here as you said right in the heart of the asteroid belt the chance of collision is infinitesimal
we ve been hoping to show you an asteroid the best we can do is hanuman a miserable three hundred metres across but the nearest we get to it is a quarter of a million kilometres
but hanuman is gigantic compared to all the unknown debris that s floating around out here
aren t you worried about that
about as worried as you are at being struck by lightning on earth
as a matter of fact i once had a narrow escape on pike s peak in colorado the flash and the bang were simultaneous
but you admit that the danger does exist and aren t we increasing the risk by the enormous speed at which we re travelling
willis of course knew the answer perfectly well once again he was putting himself in the place of his legions of unknown listeners on the planet that was getting a thousand kilometres further away with every passing second
it s hard to explain without mathematics said the captain how many times he had used that phrase
even when it wasn t true
but there s no simple relationship between speed and risk
to hit anything at spacecraft velocities would be catastrophic if you re standing next to an atomic bomb when it goes off it makes no difference whether it s in the kiloton or megaton class
that was not exactly a reassuring statement but it was the best he could do
before willis could press the point further he continued hastily and let me remind you that any er slight extra risk we may be running is in the best of causes
a single hour may save lives
yes i m sure we all appreciate that
willis paused he thought of adding and of course i m in the same boat but decided against it
it might sound immodest not that modesty had ever been his strong suit
and anyway he could hardly make a virtue of a necessity he had very little alternative now unless he decided to walk home
all this he continued brings me to another point
do you know what happened just a century and a half ago on the north atlantic
in 1911
well actually 1912 captain smith guessed what was coming and stubbornly refused to cooperate by pretending ignorance
i suppose you mean the titanic he said
precisely answered willis gamely concealing his disappointment
i ve had at least twenty reminders from people who think they re the only one who s spotted the parallel
what parallel
the titanic was running unacceptable risks merely trying to break a record
he almost added and she didn t have enough lifeboats but luckily checked himself in time when he recalled that the ship s one and only shuttle could carry not more than five passengers
if willis took him up on that it would involve altogether too many explanations
well i grant that the analogy is far fetched
but there s another striking parallel which everyone points out
do you happen to know the name of the titanic s first and last captain
i haven t the faintest began captain smith
then his jaw dropped
precisely said victor willis with a smile which it would be charitable to call smug
captain smith would willingly have strangled all those amateur researchers
but he could hardly blame his parents for bequeathing him the commonest of english names
39 the captain s table it was a pity that viewers on and off earth could not have enjoyed the less formal discussions aboard universe
shipboard life had now settled down to a steady routine punctuated by a few regular landmarks of which the most important and certainly the most long established was the traditional captain s table
at 18 hours exactly the six passengers and five of the officers not on duty would join captain smith for dinner
there was of course none of the formal dress that had been mandatory aboard the floating palaces of the north atlantic but there was usually some attempt at sartorial novelty
yva could always be relied upon to produce some new brooch ring necklace hair ribbon or perfume from an apparently inexhaustible supply
if the drive was on the meal would begin with soup but if the ship was coasting and weightless there would be a selection of hors d oeuvres
in either event before the main course was served captain smith would report the latest news or try to dispel the latest rumours usually fuelled by newscasts from earth or ganymede
accusations and countercharges were flying in all directions and the most fantastic theories had been proposed to account for galaxy s hijacking
a finger had been pointed at every secret organization known to exist and many that were purely imaginary
all the theories however had one thing in common
not one of them could suggest a plausible motive
the mystery had been compounded by the one fact which had emerged
strenuous detective work by astropol had established the surprising fact that the late rose mccullen was really ruth mason born in north london recruited to the metropolitan police and then after a promising start dismissed for racist activities
she had emigrated to africa and vanished
obviously she had become involved in that unlucky continent s political underground
shaka was frequently mentioned and as frequently denied by the ussa
what all this could possibly have to do with europa was endlessly and fruitlessly debated around the table especially when maggie m confessed that at one time she had been planning a novel about shaka from the viewpoint of one of his thousand unfortunate wives
but the more she researched the project the more repellent it became
by the time i abandoned shaka she wryly admitted i knew exactly what a modern german feels about hitler
such personal revelations became more and more common as the voyage proceeded
when the main meal was over one of the group would be given the floor for thirty minutes
between them they had a dozen lifetimes of experience on as many heavenly bodies so it would be hard to find a better source of after dinner tales
the least effective speaker was somewhat surprisingly victor willis
he was frank enough to admit it and to give the reason
i m so used he said almost but not quite apologetically to performing for an audience of millions that i find it hard to interact with a friendly little group like this
could you do better if it wasn t friendly
asked mihailovich always anxious to be helpful
that could easily be arranged
yva on the other hand turned out to be better than expected even though her memories were confined entirely to the world of entertainment
she was particularly good on the famous and infamous directors she had worked with especially david griffin
was it true asked maggie m doubtless thinking of shaka that he hated women
not at all yva answered promptly
he just hated actors
he didn t believe they were human beings
mihailovich s reminiscences also covered a somewhat limited territory the great orchestras and ballet companies famous conductors and composers and their innumerable hangers on
but he was so full of hilarious stories of backstage intrigues and liaisons and accounts of sabotaged first nights and mortal feuds among prima donnas that he kept even his most unmusical listeners convulsed with laughter and was willingly granted extra time
colonel greenburg s matter of fact accounts of extraordinary events could hardly have provided a greater contrast
the first landing at mercury s relatively temperate south pole had been so thoroughly reported that there was little new to be said about it the question that interested everyone was when will we return
that was usually followed by would you like to go back
if they ask me to of course i ll go greenburg answered
but i rather think that mercury is going to be like the moon
remember we landed there in 1969 and didn t go back again for half a lifetime
anyway mercury isn t as useful as the moon though perhaps one day it may be
there s no water there of course it was quite a surprise to find any on the moon
or i should say in the moon
though it wasn t as glamorous as landing on mercury i did a more important job setting up the aristarchus mule train
mule train
yep
before the big equatorial launcher was built and they started shooting the ice straight into orbit we had to haul it from the pit head to the imbrium spaceport
that meant levelling a road across the lava plains and bridging quite a few crevasses
the ice road we called it only three hundred kilometres but it took several lives to build the mules were eight wheeled tractors with huge tyres and independent suspension they towed up to a dozen trailers with a hundred tons of ice apiece
used to travel by night no need to shield the cargo then
i rode with them several times
the trip took about six hours we weren t out to break speed records then the ice would be offloaded into big pressurized tanks waiting for sunrise
as soon as it melted it would be pumped into the ships
the ice road is still there of course but only the tourists use it now
if they re sensible they ll drive by night as we used to do
it was pure magic with the full earth almost directly overhead so brilliant that we seldom used our own lights
and although we could talk to our friends whenever we wanted to we often switched off the radio and left it to the automatics to tell them we were ok we just wanted to be alone in that great shining emptiness while it was still there because we knew it wouldn t last
now they re building the teravolt quarksmasher running right around the equator and domes are going up all over imbrium and serenitatis
but we knew the real lunar wilderness exactly as armstrong and aldrin saw it before you could buy wish you were here cards in the post office at tranquillity base
4 monsters from earth lucky you missed the annual ball believe it or not it was just as grisly as last year s
and once again our resident mastodon dear ms wilkinson managed to crush her partners toes even on the half gee dance floor
now some business
since you won t be back for months instead of a couple of weeks admin is looking lustfully at your apartment good neighbourhood near downtown shopping area splendid view of earth on clear days etc etc
and suggests a sublet until you return
seems a good deal and will save you a lot of money
we ll collect any personal effects you d like stored
now this shaka business
we know you love pulling our legs but frankly jerry and i were horrified
i can see why maggie m turned him down yes of course we ve read her olympic lusts very enjoyable but too feminist for us
what a monster i can understand why they ve called a gang of african terrorists after him
fancy executing his warriors if they got married
and killing all the poor cows in his wretched empire just because they were female
worst of all those horrid spears he invented shocking manners jabbing them into people you ve not been properly introduced to and what a ghastly advertisement for us feys
almost enough to make one want to switch
we ve always claimed that we re gentle and kindhearted as well as madly talented and artistic of course but now you ve made us look into some of the so called great warriors as if there was anything great about killing people
we re almost ashamed of the company we ve been keeping
yes we did know about hadrian and alexander but we certainly didn t know about richard the lion heart and saladin
or julius caesar though he was everything ask antony as well as cleo
or frederick the great who does have some redeeming features look how he treated old bach
when i told jerry that at least napoleon is an exception we don t have to be saddled with him do you know what he said
i bet josephine was really a boy
try that on yva
you ve ruined our morale you rascal tarring us with that blood stained brush sorry about the mixed metaphor
you should have left us in happy ignorance despite that we send our love and so does sebastian
say hello to any europans you meet
judging by the reports from galaxy some of them would make very good partners for ms wilkinson
41 memoirs of a centenarian dr heywood floyd preferred not to talk about the first mission to jupiter and the second to lucifer ten years later
it was all so long ago and there was nothing he had not said a hundred times to congressional committees space council boards and media persons like victor willis
nevertheless he had a duty to his fellow passengers which could not be avoided
as the only living man to have witnessed the birth of a new sun and a new solar system they expected him to have some special understanding of the worlds they were now so swiftly approaching
it was a na ve assumption he could tell them far less about the galilean satellites than the scientists and engineers who had been working there for more than a generation
when he was asked what s it really like on europa
or ganymede or io or callisto he was liable to refer the enquirer rather brusquely to the voluminous reports available in the ship s library
yet there was one area where his experience was unique
half a century later he sometimes wondered if it had really happened or whether he had been asleep aboard discovery when david bowman had appeared to him
almost easier to believe that a spaceship could be haunted
but he could not have been dreaming when the floating dust motes assembled themselves into that ghostly image of a man who should have been dead for a dozen years
without the warning it had given him how clearly he remembered that its lips were motionless and the voice had come from the console speaker leonov and all aboard would have been vaporized in the detonation of jupiter
why did he do it
floyd asked during one of the after dinner sessions
i ve puzzled over that for fifty years
whatever he became after he went out in discovery s space pod to investigate the monolith he must still have had some links with the human race he was not completely alien
we know that he returned to earth briefly because of that orbiting bomb incident
and there s strong evidence that he visited both his mother and his old girlfriend that s not the action of of an entity that had discarded all emotions
what do you suppose he is now
asked willis
for that matter where is he
perhaps that last question has no meaning even for human beings
do you know where your consciousness resides
i ve no use for metaphysics
somewhere in the general area of my brain anyway
when i was a young man sighed mihailovich who had a talent for deflating the most serious discussions mine was about a metre lower down
let s assume he s on europa we know there s a monolith there and bowman was certainly associated with it in some way see how he relayed that warning
do you think he also relayed the second one telling us to stay away
which we are now going to ignore in a good cause captain smith who was usually content to let the discussion go where it wished made one of his rare interjections
dr floyd he said thoughtfully you re in a unique position and we should take advantage of it
bowman went out of his way to help you once
if he s still around he may be willing to do so again
i worry a good deal about that attempt no landings here order
if he could assure us that it was temporarily suspended let s say i d be much happier
there were several hear hear s around the table before floyd answered
yes i ve been thinking along the same lines
i ve already told galaxy to watch out for any let s say manifestations in case he tries to make contact
of course said yva he may be dead by now if ghosts can die
not even mihailovich had a suitable comment to this but yva obviously sensed that no one thought much of her contribution
undeterred she tried again
woody dear she said
why don t you simply give him a call on the radio
that s what it s for isn t it
the idea had occurred to floyd but it had somehow seemed too na ve to take seriously
i will he said
i don t suppose it will do any harm
42 minilith this time floyd was quite sure he was dreaming
he had never been able to sleep well in zero gravity and universe was now coasting unpowered at maximum velocity
in two days it would start almost a week of steady deceleration throwing away its enormous excess speed until it was able to rendezvous with europa
however many times he adjusted the restraining straps they always seemed either too tight or too loose
he would have difficulty in breathing or else he would find himself drifting out of his bunk
once he had awoken in mid air and had flailed away for several minutes until exhausted he had managed to swim the few metres to the nearest wall
not until then had he remembered that he should merely have waited the room ventilating system would have soon pulled him to the exhaust grille without any exertion on his part
as a seasoned space traveller he knew this perfectly well his only excuse was simple panic
but tonight he had managed to get everything right probably when weight returned he would have difficulty in readjusting to that
he had lain awake for only a few minutes recapitulating the latest discussion at dinner and had then fallen asleep
in his dreams he had continued the conversation around the table
there had been a few trifling changes which he accepted without surprise
willis for example had grown his beard back though on only one side of his face
this floyd presumed was in aid of some research project though he found it difficult to imagine its purpose
in any event he had his own worries
he was defending himself against the criticisms of space administrator millson who had somewhat surprisingly joined their little group
floyd wondered how he had come aboard universe could he possibly have stowed away
the fact that millson had been dead for at least forty years seemed much less important
heywood his old enemy was saying the white house is most upset
i can t imagine why
that radio message you ve just sent to europa
did it have state department clearance
i didn t think it was necessary
i merely asked permission to land
ah but that s it
who did you ask
do we recognize the government concerned
i m afraid it s all very irregular millson faded away still tut tutting
i m very glad this is only a dream thought floyd
now what
well i might have expected it
hello old friend
you come in all sizes don t you
of course even tma 1 couldn t have squeezed into my cabin and its big brother could easily have swallowed universe in one gulp
the black monolith was standing or floating only two metres from his bunk
with an uncomfortable shock of recognition floyd realized that it was not only the same shape but also the same size as an ordinary tombstone
although the resemblance had often been pointed out to him until now the incongruity of scale had lessened the psychological impact
now for the first time he felt the likeness was disquieting even sinister
i know this is only a dream but at my age i don t want any reminders
anyway what are you doing here
do you bring a message from dave bowman
are you dave bowman
well i didn t really expect an answer you weren t very talkative in the past were you
but things always happened when you were around
back in tycho sixty years ago you sent that signal to jupiter to tell your makers that we d dug you up
and look what you did to jupiter when we got there a dozen years later
what are you up to now
vi haven 43 salvage the first task confronting captain laplace and his crew once they had grown accustomed to being on terra firma was to re orient themselves
everything on galaxy was the wrong way round
spaceships are designed for two modes of operation either no gravity at all or when the engines are thrusting an up and down direction along the axis
but now galaxy was lying almost horizontally and all the floors had become walls
it was exactly as if they were trying to live in a lighthouse that had toppled on to its side every single piece of furniture had to be moved and at least fifty per cent of the equipment was not functioning properly
yet in some ways this was a blessing in disguise and captain laplace made the most of it
the crew was so busy rearranging galaxy s interior giving priority to the plumbing that he had few worries about morale
as long as the hull remained airtight and the muon generators continued to supply power they were in no immediate danger they merely had to survive for twenty days and salvation would come from the skies in the shape of universe
no one ever mentioned the possibility that the unknown powers that ruled europa might object to a second landing
they had as far as anyone knew ignored the first surely they could not interfere with a mission of mercy europa itself however was now less cooperative
while galaxy had been adrift on the open sea it had been virtually unaffected by the quakes which continually racked the little world
but now that the ship had become an all too permanent land structure it was shaken every few hours by seismic disturbances
had it touched down in the normal vertical position by now it would certainly have been overturned
the quakes were unpleasant rather than dangerous but they gave nightmares to anyone who had experienced tokyo 33 or los angeles 45
it did not help much to know that they followed a completely predictable pattern rising to a peak of violence and frequency every three and a half days when io came swinging past on its inner orbit
nor was it much consolation to know that europa s own gravitational tides were inflicting at least equal damage on io
after six days of gruelling work captain laplace was satisfied that galaxy was as near shipshape as was possible in the circumstances
he declared a holiday which most of the crew spent sleeping and then drew up a schedule for their second week on the satellite
the scientists of course wanted to explore the new world they had so unexpectedly entered
according to the radar maps that ganymede had transmitted to them the island was fifteen kilometres long and five wide its maximum elevation was only a hundred metres not high enough someone had gloomily predicted to avoid a really bad tsunami
it was hard to imagine a more dismal and forbidding place half a century of exposure to europa s feeble winds and rains had done nothing to break up the pillow lava which covered half its surface or to soften the outcropping of granite that protruded through the rivers of frozen rock
but it was their home now and they had to find a name for it
gloomy downbeat suggestions like hades inferno hell purgatory were firmly vetoed by the captain he wanted something cheerful
one surprising and quixotic tribute to a brave enemy was seriously considered before being rejected thirty two to ten with five abstentions the island would not be called roseland
in the end haven won unanimously
44 endurance history never repeats itself but historical situations recur
as he made his daily report to ganymede captain laplace kept thinking of the phrase
it had been quoted by margaret m bala now approaching at almost a thousand kilometres every second in a message of encouragement from universe which he had been very happy to relay to his fellow castaways
please tell miss m bala that her little history lesson was extremely good for morale she couldn t have thought of anything better to send us
despite the inconvenience of having our walls and floors switched around we re living in luxury compared to those old polar explorers
some of us had heard of ernest shackleton but we had no idea of the endurance saga
to have been trapped on ice floes for over a year then to spend the antarctic winter in a cave then to cross a thousand kilometres of sea in an open boat and to climb a range of unmapped mountains to reach the nearest human settlement
and yet that was only the beginning
what we find incredible and inspiring is that shackleton went back four times to rescue his men on that little island and saved every one of them
you can guess what that story s done to our spirits i hope you can fax this book to us in your next transmission we re all anxious to read it
and what would he have thought of that
yes we re infinitely better off than any of those old time explorers
it s almost impossible to believe that until well into the last century they were completely cut off from the rest of the human race once they d gone over the horizon
we should be ashamed at grumbling because light isn t fast enough and we can t talk to our friends in real time or that it takes a couple of hours to get replies from earth
they had no contact for months almost years
again miss m bala our sincerest thanks
of course all earth explorers did have one considerable advantage over us at least they could breathe the air
our science team has been clamouring to go outside and we ve modified four spacesuits for evas of up to six hours
at this atmospheric pressure they won t need full suits a waist seal is good enough and i m allowing two men to go out at a time as long as they stay within sight of the ship
finally here s today s weather report
pressure two hundred and fifty bars temperature steady at twenty five degrees wind gusting at up to thirty klicks from the west usual hundred per cent overcast quakes between one and three on open ended richter you know i never did like the sound of that open ended especially now that io s coming into conjunction again
45 mission when people asked to see him together it usually meant trouble or at least some difficult decision
captain laplace had noticed that floyd and van der berg were spending a lot of time in earnest discussions often with second officer chang and it was easy to guess what they were talking about
yet their proposal still took him by surprise
you want to go to mount zeus
how in an open boat
has that shackleton book gone to your head
floyd looked slightly embarrassed the captain was right on target
south had been an inspiration in more ways than one
even if we could build a boat sir it would take much too long especially now that universe looks like reaching us within ten days
and i m not sure added van der berg that i d care to sail on this sea of galilee not all its inhabitants may have got the message that we re inedible
so that leaves only one alternative doesn t it
i m sceptical but i m willing to be convinced
go on we ve discussed it with mr chang and he confirms that it can be done
mount zeus is only three hundred kilometres away the shuttle can fly there in less than an hour
and find a place to land
as you doubtless recall mr chang wasn t very successful with galaxy
no problem sir the william tsung s only a hundredth of our mass even that ice could probably have supported it
we ve been over the video records and found a dozen good landing sites
besides said van der berg the pilot won t have a pistol pointed at him
that could help
i m sure it will
but the big problem is at this end
how are you going to get the shuttle out of its garage
can you rig a crane
even in this gravity it would be quite a load
no need to sir
mr chang can fly it out
there was a prolonged silence while captain laplace contemplated obviously without much enthusiasm the idea of rocket motors firing inside his ship
the small shuttle william tsung more familiarly known as bill tee was designed purely for orbital operations normally it would be pushed gently out of its garage and the engines would not operate until it was well away from the mother ship
obviously you ve worked all this out said the captain grudgingly but what about the angle of take off
don t tell me you want to roll galaxy over so that bill tee can pop straight up
the garage is half way down one side lucky it wasn t underneath when we grounded
the take off will have to be at sixty degrees to the horizontal the lateral thrusters can handle it
if mr chang says so i ll certainly believe him
but what will the firing do to the ship
well it will wreck the garage interior but it will never be used again anyway
and the bulkheads are designed for accidental explosions so there s no danger of damage to the rest of the ship
we ll have fire fighting crews standing by just in case
it was a brilliant concept no doubt of that
if it worked the mission would not be a total failure
during the last week captain laplace had given scarcely a moment s thought to the mystery of mount zeus which had brought them to this predicament only survival had mattered
but now there was hope and leisure to think ahead
it would be worth taking some risks to find why this little world was the focus of so much intrigue
46 shuttle speaking from memory said dr anderson goddard s first rocket flew about fifty metres
i wonder if mr chang will beat that record
he d better or we ll all be in trouble
most of the science team had gathered in the observation lounge and everyone was staring anxiously back along the hull of the ship
although the entrance of the garage was not visible from this angle they would see the bill tee soon enough when and if it emerged
there was no countdown chang was taking his time making every possible check and would fire when he felt like it
the shuttle had been stripped down to its minimum mass and was carrying just enough propellant for one hundred seconds of flight
if everything worked that would be ample if it didn t more would not only be superfluous but dangerous
here we go said chang casually
it was almost like a conjuring trick everything happened so quickly that the eye was deceived
no one saw bill tee pop out of the garage because it was hidden in a cloud of steam
when the cloud had cleared the shuttle was already landing two hundred metres away
a great cheer of relief echoed through the lounge
he did it
cried ex acting captain lee
he s broken goddard s record easily
standing on its four stubby legs in the bleak europan landscape bill tee looked like a larger and even less elegant version of an apollo lunar module
that was not however the thought that occurred to captain laplace as he looked out from the bridge
it seemed to him that his ship was rather like a stranded whale that had managed a difficult birth in an alien element
he hoped that the new calf would survive
forty eight very busy hours later the william tsung was loaded checked out on a ten kilometre circuit over the island and ready to go
there was still plenty of time for the mission by the most optimistic reckoning universe could not arrive for another three days and the trip to mount zeus even allowing for the deployment of dr van der berg s extensive array of instruments would take only six hours
as soon as second officer chang had landed captain laplace called him to his cabin
the skipper looked thought chang somewhat ill at ease
good work walter but of course that s only what we expect
thanks sir so what s the problem
the captain smiled
a well integrated crew could keep no secrets
head office as usual
i hate to disappoint you but i ve had orders that only dr van der berg and second officer floyd are to make the trip
i get the picture chang answered with a trace of bitterness
what have you told them
nothing yet that s why i wanted to talk to you
i m quite prepared to say that you re the only pilot who can fly the mission
they ll know that s nonsense floyd could do the job as well as i could
there s not the slightest risk except for a malfunction which could happen to anyone
i d still be willing to stick my neck out if you insist
after all no one can stop me and we ll all be heroes when we get back to earth
chang was obviously doing some intricate calculations
he seemed rather pleased with the result
replacing a couple of hundred kilos of payload with propellant gives us an interesting new option i d intended to mention it earlier but there was no way bill tee could manage with all that extra gear and a full crew don t tell me
the great wall
of course we could do a complete survey in one or two passes and find what it really is
i thought we had a very good idea and i m not sure if we should go near it
that might be pressing our luck
perhaps
but there s another reason to some of us it s an even better one go on
tsien
it s only ten kilometres from the wall
we d like to drop a wreath there
so that was what his officers had been discussing so solemnly not for the first time captain laplace wished he knew a little more mandarin
i understand he said quietly
i ll have to think it over and talk to van der berg and floyd to see if they agree
and head office
no dammit
this will be my decision
47 shards you d better hurry ganymede central had advised the next conjunction will be a bad one we ll be triggering quakes as well as io
and we don t want to scare you but unless our radar s gone crazy your mountain s sunk another hundred metres since the last check
at that rate thought van der berg europa will be flat again in ten years
how much faster things happened here than on earth which was one reason why the place was so popular with geologists
now that he was strapped into the number two position immediately behind floyd and virtually surrounded by consoles of his own equipment he felt a curious mixture of excitement and regret
in a few hours the great intellectual adventure of his life would be over one way or the other
nothing that would ever happen again could possibly match it
he did not have the slightest trace of fear his confidence in both man and machine was complete
one unexpected emotion was a wry sense of gratitude to the late rose mccullen without her he would never have had this opportunity but might have gone still uncertain to his grave
the heavily laden bill tee could barely manage one tenth of a gravity at lift off it was not intended for this sort of work but would manage much better on the homeward journey when it had deposited its cargo
it seemed to take ages to climb clear of galaxy and they had ample time to note the damage to the hull as well as signs of corrosion from the occasional mildly acid rains
while floyd concentrated on the lift off van der berg gave a quick report on the ship s condition from the viewpoint of a privileged observer
it seemed the right thing to do even though with any luck galaxy s space worthiness would soon be of no further concern to anyone
now they could see the whole of haven spread out beneath them and van der berg realized what a brilliant job acting captain lee had done when he beached the ship
there were only a few places where it could have been safely grounded although a good deal of luck had also been involved lee had used wind and sea anchor to the best possible advantage
the mists closed around them bill tee was rising on a semi ballistic trajectory to minimize drag and there would be nothing to see except the clouds for twenty minutes
a pity thought van der berg i m sure there must be some interesting creatures swimming around down there and no one else may have a chance of seeing them
coming up to engine cut off said floyd
everything normal
very good bill tee
no report of traffic at your altitude
you re still number one on the runway to land
who s that joker
asked van der berg
ronnie lim
believe it or not that number one on the runway goes back to apollo
van der berg could understand why
there was nothing like the occasional touch of humour providing it was not overdone to relieve the strain when men were involved in some complex and possibly hazardous enterprise
fifteen minutes before we start braking said floyd
let s see who else is on the air
he started the autoscan and a succession of beeps and whistles separated by short silences as the tuner rejected them one by one in its swift climb up the radio spectrum echoed round the little cabin
your local beacons and data transmissions said floyd
i was hoping ah here we are
it was only a faint musical tone warbling rapidly up and down like a demented soprano
floyd glanced at the frequency meter
doppler shift almost gone she s slowing fast
what is it text
slowscan video i think
they re relaying a lot of material back to earth through the big dish on ganymede when it s in the right position
the networks are yelling for news
they listened to the hypnotic but meaningless sound for a few minutes then floyd switched it off
incomprehensible though the transmission from universe was to their unaided senses it conveyed the only message that mattered
help was on the way and would soon be there
partly to fill the silence but also because he was genuinely interested van der berg remarked casually have you talked to your grandfather lately
talked of course was a misnomer where interplanetary distances were concerned but no one had come up with an acceptable alternative
voicegram audiomail and vocard had all flourished briefly then vanished into limbo
even now most of the human race probably did not believe that realtime conversation was impossible in the solar system s wide open spaces and from time to time indignant protests were heard why can t you scientists do something about it
yes said floyd
he s in fine shape and i look forward to meeting him
there was a slight strain in his voice
i wonder thought van der berg when they last met but he realized that it would be tactless to ask
instead he spent the next ten minutes rehearsing the off loading and setting up procedures with floyd so there would be no unnecessary confusion when they touched down
the commence braking alarm went off just a fraction of a second after floyd had already started the program sequencer
i m in good hands thought van der berg i can relax and concentrate on my job
where s that camera don t say it s floated away again
the clouds were clearing
even though the radar had shown exactly what was beneath them in a display as good as normal vision could provide it was still a shock to see the face of the mountain rearing up only a few kilometres ahead
look
cried floyd suddenly
over to the left by that double peak give you one guess
i m sure you re right i don t think we did any damage it just splattered wonder where the other one hit altitude one thousand
which landing site
alpha doesn t look so good from here
you re right try gamma closer to the mountain anyway
five hundred
gamma it is
i ll hover for twenty secs if you don t like it we ll switch to beta
four hundred three hundred two hundred
good luck bill tee said galaxy briefly
thanks ronnie one hundred and fifty one hundred fifty how about it
just a few small rocks and that s peculiar what looks like broken glass all over the place someone s had a wild party here fifty fifty
still ok
perfect
go down
forty thirty twenty sure you don t want to change your mind
ten
kicking up a little dust as neil said once or was it buzz
five
contact
easy wasn t it
don t know why they bother to pay me
48 lucy hello gany central we ve made a perfect landing i mean chris has on a flat surface of some metamorphic rock probably the same pseudogranite we ve called havenite
the base of the mountain is only two kilometres away but already i can tell there s no real need to go any closer
we re putting on our top suits now and will start unloading in five minutes
will leave the monitors running of course and will call on every quarter hour
van out
what did you mean by that no need to go any closer
asked floyd
van der berg grinned
in the last few minutes he seemed to have shed years and almost to have become a carefree boy
circumspice he said happily
latin for look around you
let s get the big camera out first wow
the bill tee gave a sudden lurch and for a moment heaved up and down on its landing gear shock absorbers with a motion that if it had continued for more than a few seconds would have been a recipe for instant sea sickness
ganymede was right about those quakes said floyd when they had recovered
is there any serious danger
probably not it s still thirty hours to conjunction and this looks a solid slab of rock
but we won t waste any time here luckily we won t need to
is my mask straight
it doesn t feel right
let me tighten the strap
that s better
breathe in hard good now it fits fine
i ll go first
van der berg wished that his could be the first small step but floyd was the commander and it was his duty to check that the bill tee was in good shape and ready for an immediate take off
he walked once around the little spacecraft examining the landing gear then gave the thumbs up signal to van der berg who started down the ladder to join him
although he had worn the same lightweight breathing equipment on his exploration of haven he felt a little awkward with it and paused at the landing pad to make some adjustments
then he glanced up and saw what floyd was doing
don t touch it
he cried
it s dangerous
floyd jumped a good metre away from the shards of vitreous rock he was examining
to his untrained eye they looked rather like an unsuccessful melt from a large glass furnace
it s not radioactive is it
he asked anxiously
no
but stay away until i ve got there
to his surprise floyd realized that van der berg was wearing heavy gloves
as a space officer it had taken him a long time to grow accustomed to the fact that here on europa it was safe to expose one s bare skin to the atmosphere
nowhere else in the solar system even on mars was that possible
very cautiously van der berg reached down and picked up a long splinter of the glassy material
even in this diffused light it glittered strangely and floyd could see that it had a vicious edge
the sharpest knife in the known universe said van der berg happily
we ve been through all this to find a knife
van der berg started to laugh then found it wasn t easy inside his mask
so you still don t know what this is about
i m beginning to feel i m the only one who doesn t
van der berg took his companion by the shoulder and turned him to face the looming mass of mount zeus
from this distance it filled half the sky not merely the greatest but the only mountain on this whole world
admire the view just for one minute
i have an important call to make
he punched a code sequence on his comset waited for the ready light to flash and said ganymede central 1 9 this is van
do you receive
after no more than the minimum timelag an obviously electronic voice answered hello van
this is ganymede central 1 9
ready to receive
van der berg paused savouring the moment he would remember for the rest of his life
contact earth ident uncle 737
relay following message
lucy is here
lucy is here
end message
please repeat
perhaps i should have stopped him saying that whatever it means thought floyd as ganymede repeated the message
but it s too late now
it will reach earth within the hour
sorry about that chris grinned van der berg
i wanted to establish priority amongst other things
unless you start talking soon i ll begin carving you up with one of these patent glass knives
glass indeed
well the explanation can wait it s absolutely fascinating but quite complicated
so i ll give you the straight facts
mount zeus is a single diamond approximate mass one million million tons
or if you prefer it that way about two times ten to the seventeenth carats
but i can t guarantee that it s all gem quality
vii the great wall 49 shrine as they unloaded the equipment from bill tee and set it up on their little granite landing pad chris floyd found it hard to tear his eyes away from the mountain looming above them
a single diamond bigger than everest
why the scattered fragments lying round the shuttle must be worth billions rather than millions
on the other hand they might be worth no more than well scraps of broken glass
the value of diamonds had always been controlled by the dealers and producers but if a literal gem mountain came suddenly on the market prices would obviously collapse completely
now floyd began to understand why so many interested parties had focused their attention upon europa the political and economic ramifications were endless
now that he had at last proved his theory van der berg had become again the dedicated and single minded scientist anxious to complete his experiment with no further distraction
with floyd s help it was not easy to get some of the bulkier pieces of equipment out of bill tee s cramped cabin they first drilled a metre long core with a portable electric drill and carried it carefully back to the shuttle
floyd would have had a different set of priorities but he recognized that it made sense to do the harder tasks first
not until they had laid out a seismograph array and erected a panoramic tv camera on a low heavy tripod did van der berg condescend to collect some of the incomputable riches lying all around them
at the very least he said as he carefully selected some of the less lethal fragments they ll make good souvenirs
unless rosie s friends murder us to get them
van der berg looked sharply at his companion he wondered how much chris really knew and how much like all of them he was guessing
not worth their while now that the secret s out
in about an hour s time the stock exchange computers will be going crazy
you bastard
said floyd with admiration rather than rancour
so that s what your messsage was about
there s no law that says a scientist shouldn t make a little profit on the side but i m leaving the sordid details to my friends on earth
honestly i m much more interested in the job we re doing here
let me have that wrench please three times before they had finished establishing zeus station they were almost knocked off their feet by quakes
they could feel them first as a vibration underfoot then everything would start shaking then there would be a horrible long drawn out groaning sound that seemed to come from every direction
it was even air borne which to floyd seemed strangest of all
he could not quite get used to the fact that there was enough atmosphere around them to allow short range conversations without radio
van der berg kept assuring him that the quakes were still quite harmless but floyd had learned never to put too much trust in experts
true the geologist had just been proved spectacularly right as he looked at bill tee heaving on its shock absorbers like a storm tossed ship he hoped that van s luck would hold for at least a few more minutes
that seems to be it said the scientist at last to floyd s great relief
ganymede s getting good data on all channels
the batteries will last for years with the solar panel to keep recharging them
if this gear is still standing a week from now i ll be very surprised
i ll swear that mountain s moved since we landed let s get off before it falls on top of us
i m more worried laughed van der berg that your jet blast will undo all our work
no risk of that we re well clear and now we ve offloaded so much junk we ll need only half power to lift
unless you want to take aboard a few more billions
or trillions
let s not be greedy
anyway i can t even guess what this will be worth when we get it to earth
the museums will grab most of it of course
after that who knows
floyd s fingers were flying over the control panel as he exchanged messages with galaxy
first stage of mission completed
bill tee ready for take off
flight plan as agreed
they were not surprised when captain laplace answered
you re quite certain you want to go ahead
remember you have the final decision
i ll back you up whatever it is
yessir we re both happy
we understand how the crew feels
and the scientific payoff could be enormous we re both very excited
just a minute we re still waiting for your report on mount zeus
floyd looked at van der berg who shrugged his shoulders and then took the microphone
if we told you now captain you d think we were crazy or pulling your leg
please wait a couple of hours until we re back with the evidence
hm
not much point giving you an order is it
anyway good luck
and from the owner as well he thinks going to tsien is a splendid idea
i knew sir lawrence would approve floyd remarked to his companion
and anyway with galaxy already a total loss bill tee s not much extra risk is it
van der berg could see his point of view even though he did not entirely subscribe to it
he had made his scientific reputation but he still looked forward to enjoying it
oh by the way floyd said
who was lucy anybody in particular
not as far as i know
we came across her in a computer search and decided the name would make a good code word everyone would assume it was something to do with lucifer which is just enough of a half truth to be beautifully misleading i d never heard of them but a hundred years ago there was a group of popular musicians with a very strange name the beatles spelled b e a t l e s don t ask me why
and they wrote a song with an equally strange title lucy in the sky with diamonds
weird isn t it
almost as if they knew according to ganymede radar the wreck of the tsien lay three hundred kilometres west of mount zeus towards the twilight zone and the cold lands beyond
permanently cold they were but not dark half the time they were brilliantly lit by the distant sun
however even by the end of the long europan solar day the temperature was still far below freezing point
as liquid water could exist only on the hemisphere facing lucifer the intermediate region was a place of continual storms where rain and hail sleet and snow contended for supremacy
during the half century since tsien s disastrous landing the ship had moved almost a thousand kilometres
it must have drifted like galaxy for several years on the newly created sea of galilee before coming to rest on its bleakly inhospitable shore
floyd picked up the radar echo as soon as bill tee flattened out at the end of its second leap across europa
the signal was surprisingly weak for so large an object as soon as they broke through the clouds they realized why
the wreck of the spaceship tsien first man carrying vessel to land on a satellite of jupiter stood in the centre of a small circular lake obviously artificial and connected by a canal to the sea less than three kilometres away
only the skeleton was left and not even all of that the carcass had been picked clean
but by what
van der berg asked
there was no sign of life there the place looked as if it had been deserted for years
yet he had not the slightest doubt that something had stripped the wreck with deliberate and indeed almost surgical precision
obviously safe to land said floyd waiting for a few seconds to get van der berg s almost absentminded nod of approval
the geologist was already videoing everything in sight
bill tee settled down effortlessly by the side of the pool and they looked across the cold dark water at this monument to man s exploring impulses
there seemed no convenient way of getting to the wreck but that did not really matter
when they had suited up they carried the wreath to the water s edge held it solemnly for a moment in front of the camera then tossed in this tribute from galaxy s crew
it had been beautifully made even though the only raw materials available were metal foil paper and plastic one could easily believe that the flowers and leaves were real
pinned all over them were notes and inscriptions many written in the ancient but now officially obsolete script rather than roman characters
as they were walking back to the bill tee floyd said thoughtfully did you notice there was practically no metal left
only glass plastic synthetics
what about those ribs and supporting girders
composite mostly carbon boron
someone round here is very hungry for metal and knows it when it sees it
interesting very thought van der berg
on a world where fire could not exist metals and alloys would be almost impossible to make and as precious as well diamonds
when he had reported to base and received a message of gratitude from second officer chang and his colleagues floyd took the bill tee up to a thousand metres and continued westward
last lap he said no point in going higher we ll be there in ten minutes
but i won t land if the great wall is what we think it is i d prefer not to
we ll do a quick flyby and head for home
get those cameras ready this could be even more important than mount zeus
and he added to himself i may soon know what grandfather heywood felt not so far from here fifty years ago
we ll have a lot to talk about when we meet less than a week from now if all goes well
5 open city what a terrible place thought chris floyd nothing but driving sleet flurries of snow occasional glimpses of landscapes streaked with ice why haven was a tropical paradise by comparison
yet he knew that the nightside only a few hundred kilometres further on round the curve of europa was even worse
to his surprise the weather cleared suddenly and completely just before they reached their goal
the clouds lifted and there ahead was an immense black wall almost a kilometre high lying directly across bill tee s flight path
it was so huge that it was obviously creating its own microclimate the prevailing winds were being deflected around it leaving a local calm area in its lee
it was instantly recognizable as the monolith and sheltering at its foot were hundreds of hemispherical structures gleaming a ghostly white in the rays of the low hanging sun that had once been jupiter
they looked thought floyd exactly like old style beehives made of snow something in their appearance evoked other memories of earth
van der berg was one jump ahead of him
igloos he said
same problem same solution
no other building material around here except rock which would be much harder to work
and the low gravity must help some of those domes are quite large
i wonder what lives in them they were still too far away to see anything moving in the streets of this little city at the edge of the world
and as they came closer they saw that there were no streets
it s venice made of ice said floyd
all igloos and canals
amphibians answered van der berg
we should have expected it
i wonder where they are
we may have scared them
bill tee s much noisier outside than in
for a moment van der berg was too busy filming and reporting to galaxy to reply
then he said we can t possibly leave without making some contact
you re right this is far bigger than mount zeus
and it could be more dangerous
i don t see any sign of advanced technology correction that looks like an old twentieth century radar dish over there
can you get closer
and get shot at
no thanks
besides we re using up our hover time
only another ten minutes if you want to get home again
can we at least land and look around
there s a patch of clear rock over there
where the hell is everybody
scared like me
nine minutes
i ll do one trip across town film everything you can yes galaxy we re ok just rather busy at the moment call you later i ve just realized that s not a radar dish but something almost as interesting
it s pointing straight at lucifer it s a solar furnace
makes a lot of sense in a place where the sun never moves and you can t light a fire
eight minutes
too bad everyone s hiding indoors
or back in the water
can we look at that big building with the open space around it
i think it s the town hall
van der berg was pointing towards a structure much larger than all the others and of quite different design it was a collection of vertical cylinders like oversized organ pipes
moreover it was not the featureless white of the igloos but showed a complex mottling over its entire surface
europan art
cried van der berg
that s a mural of some kind
closer closer
we must get a record
obediently floyd dropped lower and lower and lower
he seemed to have completely forgotten all his earlier reservations about hover time and suddenly with shocked incredulity van der berg realized that he was going to land
the scientist tore his eyes from the rapidly approaching ground and glanced at his pilot
though he was obviously still in full control of bill tee floyd seemed to be hypnotized he was staring at a fixed point straight ahead of the descending shuttle
what s the matter chris
van der berg cried
do you know what you re doing
of course
can t you see him
see who
that man standing by the biggest cylinder
and he s not wearing any breathing gear
don t be an idiot chris there s no one there
he s looking up at us
he s waving i think i recog oh my god
there s no one no one
pull up
floyd ignored him completely
he was absolutely calm and professional as he brought bill tee in to a perfect landing and cut the motor at exactly the right instant before touchdown
very thoroughly he checked the instrument readings and set the safety switches
only when he had completed the landing sequence did he again look out of the observation window with a puzzled but happy expression on his face
hello grandfather he said softly to no one at all that van der berg could see
51 phantom even in his most horrible nightmares dr van der berg had never imagined being stranded on a hostile world in a tiny space capsule with only a madman for company
but at least chris floyd did not seem to be violent perhaps he could be humoured into taking off again and flying them safely back to galaxy
he was still staring at nothing and from time to time his lips moved in silent conversation
the alien town remained completely deserted and one could almost imagine that it had been abandoned for centuries
presently however van der berg noticed some tell tale signs of recent occupancy
although bill tee s rockets had blasted away the thin layer of snow immediately around them the remainder of the little square was still lightly powdered
it was a page torn from a book covered with signs and hieroglyphics some of which he could read
a heavy object had been dragged in that direction or had made its way clumsily under its own power
leading from the now closed entrance of one igloo was the unmistakable track of a wheeled vehicle
too far away to make out details was a small object that could have been a discarded container perhaps europans were sometimes as careless as humans
the presence of life was unmistakable overwhelming
van der berg felt he was being watched by a thousand eyes or other senses and there was no way of guessing whether the minds behind them were friendly or hostile
they might even be indifferent merely waiting for the intruders to go away so that they could continue their interrupted and mysterious business
then chris floyd spoke once again into the empty air
goodbye grandfather he said quietly with just a trace of sadness
turning towards van der berg he added in a normal conversational tone he says it s time to leave
i guess you must think i m crazy
it was wisest decided van der berg not to agree
in any event he soon had something else to worry about
floyd was now staring anxiously at the read outs that bill tee s computer was feeding to him
presently he said in an understandable tone of apology sorry about this van
that landing used up more fuel than i d intended
we ll have to change the mission profile
that van der berg thought bleakly was a rather roundabout way of saying we can t get back to galaxy
with difficulty he
managed to suppress a damn your grandfather
and merely asked so what do we do
floyd was studying the chart and punching in more numbers
we can t stay here why not
thought van der berg
if we re going to die anyway we might use our time learning as much as possible
so we should find a place where the shuttle from universe can pick us up easily
van der berg breathed a huge mental sigh of relief
stupid of him not to have thought of that he felt like a man who had been reprieved just when he was being taken to the gallows
universe should reach europa in less than four days bill tee s accommodation could hardly be called luxurious but it was infinitely preferable to most of the alternatives he could imagine
away from this filthy weather a stable flat surface closer to galaxy though i m not sure if that helps much shouldn t be any problem
we ve enough for five hundred kilometres it s just that we can t risk the sea crossing
for a moment van der berg thought wistfully of mount zeus there was so much that could be done there
but the seismic disturbances steadily getting worse as lo came into line with lucifer ruled that out completely
he wondered if his instruments were still working and would check them again as soon as they d dealt with the immediate problem
i ll fly down the coast to the equator best place to be anyway for a shuttle landing the radar map showed some smooth areas just inland round sixty west
i know
the masada plateau
and van der berg added to himself perhaps a chance for a little more exploring
never miss an unexpected opportunity the plateau it is
goodbye venice
goodbye grandfather when the muted roar of the braking rockets had died away chris floyd safetied the firing circuits for the last time released his seat belt and stretched arms and legs as far as he could in bill tee s confined quarters
not such a bad view for europa he said cheerfully
now we ve four days to find out if shuttle rations are as bad as they claim
so which of us starts talking first
52 on the couch i wish i d studied some psychology thought van der berg then i could explore the parameters of his delusion
yet now he seems completely sane except on that one subject
though almost any seat was comfortable at one sixth of a gravity floyd had tilted his to the fully reclining position and had clasped his hands behind his head
van der berg suddenly recalled that this was the classic position of a patient in the days of the old and still not entirely discredited freudian analysis
he was glad to let the other talk first partly out of sheer curiosity but chiefly because he hoped that the sooner floyd got this nonsense out of his system the sooner he would be cured or at least harmless
but he did not feel too optimistic there must have been some serious deep seated problem in the first place to trigger so powerful an illusion
it was very disconcerting to find that floyd agreed with him completely and had already made his own diagnosis
my crew psych rating is al plus he said which means that they ll even let me look at my own files only about ten per cent can do this
so i m as baffled as you are but i saw grandfather and he spoke to me
i ve never believed in ghosts who does
but this must mean that he s dead
i wish i could have got to know him better i d been looking forward to our meeting
still now i have something to remember presently van der berg asked tell me exactly what he said
chris smiled a little wanly and answered i ve never had one of those total recall memories and i was so stunned by the whole thing that i can t give you many of the actual words
he paused and a look of concentration appeared on his face
that s strange now i look back i don t think we did use words
even worse thought van der berg telepathy as well as survival after death
but he merely said well give me the general gist of the er conversation
i never heard you say anything remember
right
he said something like i wanted to see you again and i m very happy
i m sure everything is going to work out well and universe will soon pick you up
typical bland spirit message thought van der berg
they never say anything useful or surprising merely reflect the hopes and fears of the listener
zero information echoes from the subconscious
go on
then i asked him where everyone was why the place was deserted
he laughed and gave me an answer i still don t understand
something like i know you didn t intend any harm when we saw you coming we barely had time to give the warning
all the and here he used a word i couldn t pronounce even if i could remember it got into the water they can move quite quickly when they have to
they won t come out until you ve left and the wind has blown the poison away
what could he have meant by that
our exhaust is nice clean steam and that s what most of their atmosphere is anyway
well thought van der berg i suppose there s no law that says a delusion any more than a dream has to make logical sense
perhaps the concept of poison symbolizes some deep rooted fear that chris despite his excellent psych rating is unable to face
whatever it is i doubt if it s any concern of mine
poison indeed
bill tee s propellant mass is pure distilled water shipped up to orbit from ganymede
but wait a minute
how hot is it when it comes out of the exhaust
haven t i read somewhere
chris said van der berg cautiously after the water s gone through the reactor does it all come out as steam
what else could it do
oh if we run really hot ten or fifteen per cent gets cracked to hydrogen and oxygen
oxygen
van der berg felt a sudden chill even though the shuttle was at comfortable room temperature
it was most unlikely that floyd understood the implications of what he had just said the knowledge was outside his normal sphere of expertise
did you know chris that to primitive organisms on earth and certainly to creatures living in an atmosphere like europa s oxygen is a deadly poison
you re joking
i m not it s even poisonous to us at high pressure
i did know that we were taught it in our diving course
your grandfather was talking sense
it s as if we d sprayed that city with mustard gas
well not quite as bad as that it would disperse very quickly
so now you believe me
i never said i didn t
you would have been crazy if you did
that broke the tension and they had a good laugh together
you never told me what he was wearing
an old fashioned dressing gown just as i remembered when i was a boy
looked very comfortable
any other details
now you mention it he looked much younger and had more hair than when i saw him last
so i don t think he was what can i say
real
something like a computer generated image
or a synthetic hologram
the monolith
yes that s what i thought
you remember how dave bowman appeared to grandfather on discovery
perhaps it s his turn now
but why
he didn t give me any warning not even any particular message
just wanted to say goodbye and wish me well for a few embarrassing moments floyd s face began to crumple then he regained control and smiled at van der berg
i ve done enough talking
now it s your turn to explain just what a million million ton diamond is doing on a world made mostly of ice and sulphur
it had better be good
it is said dr rolf van der berg
53 pressure cooker when i was studying at flagstaff began van der berg i came across an old astronomy book that said the solar system consists of the sun jupiter and assorted debris
puts earth in its place doesn t it
and hardly fair to saturn uranus and neptune the other three gas giants come to almost half as much as jupiter
but i d better start with europa
as you know it was flat ice before lucifer started warming it up greatest elevation only a couple of hundred metres and it wasn t much different after the ice had melted and a lot of the water had migrated and frozen out on farside
from 2 15 when our detailed observations began until 38 there was only one high point on the whole moon and we know what that was
we certainly do
but even though i ve seen it with my own eyes i still can t picture the monolith as a wall
i always visualize it as standing upright or floating freely in space
i think we ve learned that it can do anything it wants to anything we can imagine and a lot more
well something happened to europa in 37 between one observation and the next
mount zeus all of ten kilometres high
suddenly appeared
volcanoes that big don t pop up in a couple of weeks besides europa s nothing like as active as io
it s active enough for me floyd grumbled
did you feel that one
besides if it had been a volcano it would have spewed enormous amounts of gas into the atmosphere there were some changes but nothing like enough to account for that explanation
it was all a complete mystery and because we were scared of getting too close and were busy on our own projects we didn t do much except spin fantastic theories
none of them as it turned out as fantastic as the truth
i first suspected it from some chance observations in 57 but didn t really take them seriously for a couple of years
then the evidence became stronger for anything less bizarre it would have been completely convincing
but before i could believe that mount zeus was made of diamond i had to find an explanation
to a good scientist and i think i m a good one no fact is really respectable until there s a theory to account for it
the theory may turn out to be wrong it usually is in some details at least but it must provide a working hypothesis
and as you pointed out a million million ton diamond on a world of ice and sulphur takes a little explaining
of course now it s perfectly obvious and i feel a damn fool not to have seen the answer years ago
might have saved a lot of trouble and at least one life if i had
he paused thoughtfully then suddenly asked floyd anyone mention dr paul kreuger to you
no
why should they
i ve heard of him of course
i just wondered
a lot of strange things have been going on and i doubt if we ll ever know all the answers
anyway it s no secret now so it doesn t matter
two years ago i sent a confidential message to paul oh sorry i should have mentioned he s my uncle with a summary of my findings
i asked if he could explain them or refute them
didn t take him long with all the byte bashing he s got at his fingertips
unfortunately he was careless or someone was monitoring his network i m sure your friends whoever they are must have a good idea by now
in a couple of days he dug up an eighty year old paper in the scientific journal nature yes it was still printed on paper back then
which explained everything
well almost everything
it was written by a man working in one of the big labs in the united states of america of course the ussa didn t exist then
it was a place where they designed nuclear weapons so they knew a few things about high temperatures and pressures
i don t know if dr ross that was his name had anything to do with bombs but his background must have started him thinking about conditions deep down inside the giant planets
in his 1984 sorry 1981 paper it s less than a page long by the way he made some very interesting suggestions he pointed out that there were gigantic quantities of carbon in the form of methane ch4 in the gas giants
up to seventeen per cent of the total mass
he calculated that at the pressures and temperatures in the cores millions of atmospheres the carbon would separate out sink down towards the centres and you ve guessed it crystallize
it was a lovely theory i don t suppose he ever dreamed that there would be a hope of testing it
so that s part one of the story
in some ways part two is even more interesting
what about some more of that coffee
here you are and i think i ve already guessed part two
obviously something to do with the explosion of jupiter
not explosion implosion jupiter just collapsed on itself then ignited
in some ways it was like the detonation of a nuclear bomb except that the new state was a stable one in fact a minisun
now very strange things happen during implosions it s almost as if pieces can go through each other and come out on the other side
whatever the mechanism a mountain sized piece of the diamond core was shot into orbit
it must have made hundreds of revolutions been perturbed by the gravitational fields of all the satellites before it ended up on europa
and conditions must have been exactly right one body must have overtaken the other so the impact velocity was only a couple of kilometres a second
if they d met head on well there might not be a europa now let alone mount zeus
and i sometimes have nightmares thinking that it could very well have come down on us the new atmosphere may also have buffered the impact even so the shock must have been appalling i wonder what it did to our europan friends
it certainly triggered a whole series of tectonic disturbances which are still continuing
and said floyd political ones
i m just beginning to appreciate some of them
no wonder the ussa was worried
amongst others
but would anyone seriously imagine they could get at these diamonds
we ve not done so badly answered van der berg gesturing towards the back of the shuttle
in any case the mere psychological effect on the industry would be enormous
that s why so many people were anxious to know whether it was true or not
and now they know
what next
that s not my problem thank god
but i hope i ve made a sizeable contribution to ganymede s science budget
as well as my own he added to himself
54 reunion whatever made you think i was dead
cried heywood floyd
i ve not felt better for years
paralysed with astonishment chris floyd stared at the speaker grille
he felt a great lifting of his spirits yet also a sense of indignation
someone something had played a cruel practical joke on him but for what conceivable reason
fifty million kilometres away and coming closer by several hundred every second heywood floyd also sounded slightly indignant
but he also sounded vigorous and cheerful and his voice radiated the happiness he obviously felt at knowing that chris was safe
and i ve got some more good news for you the shuttle will pick you up first
it will drop some urgent medical supplies at galaxy then hop over to you and bring you up to rendezvous with us on the next orbit
universe will go down five orbits later you ll be able to greet your friends when they come aboard
no more now except to say how much i m looking forward to making up for lost time
waiting for your answer in let s see about three minutes for a moment there was complete silence aboard bill tee van der berg dared not look at his companion
then floyd keyed the microphone and said slowly grandad what a wonderful surprise i m still in a state of shock
but i know i met you here on europa i know you said goodbye to me
i m as certain of that as i m sure you were speaking to me just now well we ll have plenty of time to talk about it later
but remember how dave bowman spoke to you aboard discovery
perhaps it was something like that
now we ll just sit and wait here until the shuttle comes for us
we re quite comfortable there s an occasional quake but nothing to worry about
until we meet all my love
he could not remember when he had last used that word to his grandfather
after the first day the shuttle cabin began to smell
after the second they didn t notice but agreed that the food was no longer quite so tasty
they also found it hard to sleep and there were even accusations of snoring
on day three despite frequent bulletins from universe galaxy and earth itself boredom was beginning to set in and they had exhausted their supply of dirty stories
but that was the last day
before it was over lady jasmine descended seeking her lost child
55 magma baas said the apartment s master comset i accessed that special programme from ganymede while you were sleeping
do you wish to see it now
yes answered dr paul kreuger
speed ten times
no sound
there would he knew be a lot of introductory material he could jump and view later if he wished
he wanted to get to the action as quickly as possible
credits flashed up and there on the monitor was victor willis somewhere on ganymede gesticulating wildly in total silence
dr paul kreuger like many working scientists took a somewhat jaundiced view of willis though he admitted that he performed a useful function
willis abruptly vanished to be replaced by a less agitated subject mount zeus
but that was much more active than any well behaved mountain should be dr kreuger was astonished to see how much it had changed since the last transmission from europa
real time he ordered
sound
almost a hundred metres a day and the tilt has increased fifteen degrees
tectonic activity now violent extensive lava flows around the base i have dr van der berg with me van what do you think
my nephew looks in remarkably good shape thought dr kreuger considering what he s been through
good stock of course
the crust obviously never recovered from the original impact and it s giving way under the accumulated stresses
mount zeus has been slowly sinking ever since we discovered it but the rate has speeded up enormously in the last few weeks
you can see the movement from day to day
how long before it disappears completely
i can t really believe that will happen there was a quick cut to another view of the mountain with victor willis speaking off camera
that was what dr van der berg said two days ago
any comment now van
er it looks as if i was mistaken
it s going down quite incredible only half a kilometre left
i refuse to make any more predictions very wise of you van well that was only yesterday
now we ll give you a continuous time lapse sequence up to the moment we lost the camera dr paul kreuger leaned forward in his seat watching the final act of the long drama in which he had played such a remote yet vital role
there was no need to speed up the replay he was already seeing it at almost a hundred times normal
an hour was compressed into a minute a man s lifetime into that of a butterfly
before his eyes mount zeus was sinking
spurts of molten sulphur rocketed skywards around it at dazzling speed forming parabolas of brilliant electric blue
it was like a ship going down in a stormy sea surrounded by st elmo s fire
not even io s spectacular volcanoes could match this display of violence
the greatest treasure ever discovered vanishing from sight said willis in hushed and reverential tones unfortunately we can t show the finale
you ll soon see why
the action slowed down into real time
only a few hundred metres of the mountain were left and the eruptions around it now moved at a more leisurely speed
suddenly the whole picture tilted the camera s image stabilizers which had been holding their own valiantly against the continuous trembling of the ground gave up the unequal battle
for a moment it seemed as if the mountain was rising again but it was the camera tripod toppling over
the very last scene from europa was a close up of a glowing wave of molten sulphur about to engulf the equipment
gone for ever
lamented willis
riches infinitely greater than all the wealth that golconda or kimberley ever produced
what a tragic heartbreaking loss
what a stupid idiot
spluttered dr kreuger
doesn t he realize it was time for another letter to nature
and this secret would be much too big to hide
56 perturbation theory from professor paul kreuger frs etc
to the editor nature data bank public access subject mount zeus and jovian diamonds as is now well understood the europan formation known as mount zeus was originally part of jupiter
the suggestion that the cores of the gas giants might consist of diamond was first made by marvin ross of the university of california s lawrence livermore national laboratory in a classic paper the ice layer in uranus and neptune diamonds in the sky
nature vol 292 no
5822 pp
435 6 3 july 1981
surprisingly ross did not extend his calculations to jupiter
the sinking of mount zeus has produced a veritable chorus of lamentations all of which are totally ridiculous for the reasons given below
without going into details which will be presented in a later communication i estimate that the diamond core of jupiter must have had an original mass of at least 1 28 grams
this is ten billion times that of mount zeus
although much of this material would doubtless have been destroyed in the detonation of the planet and the formation of the apparently artificial sun lucifer it is inconceivable that mount zeus was the only fragment to survive
although much would have fallen back on to lucifer a substantial percentage must have gone into orbit and must still be there
elementary perturbation theory shows that it will return periodically to its point of origin
it is not of course possible to make an exact calculation but i estimate that at least a million times the mass of mount zeus is still orbiting in the vicinity of lucifer
the loss of one small fragment in any case most inconveniently located on europa is therefore of virtually no importance
i propose the establishment as soon as possible of a dedicated space radar system to search for this material
although extremely thin diamond film has been mass produced since as long ago as 1982 it has never been possible to make diamond in bulk
its availability in megaton quantities could totally transform many industries and create wholly new ones
in particular as was pointed out by isaacs et al almost a hundred years ago see science 151 pp
682 3 1966 diamond is the only construction material which would make possible the so called space elevator allowing transportation away from earth at negligible cost
the diamond mountains now orbiting among the satellites of jupiter may open up the entire solar system how trivial by comparison appear all the ancient uses of the quartic crystallized form of carbon
for completeness i would like to mention another possible location for enormous quantities of diamond a place unfortunately even more inaccessible than the core of a giant planet
it has been suggested that the crusts of neutron stars may be largely composed of diamond
as the nearest known neutron star is fifteen light years away and has a surface gravity seventy thousand million times that of earth this can hardly be regarded as a plausible source of supply
but then who could ever have imagined that one day we would be able to touch the core of jupiter
57 interlude on ganymede these poor primitive colonists
lamented mihailovich
i m horrified there s not a single concert grand on the whole of ganymede
of course the thimbleful of optronics in my synthesizer can reproduce any musical instrument
but a steinway is still a steinway just as a strad is still a strad
his complaints though not altogether serious had already aroused some counter reactions among the local intelligentsia
the popular morning mede programme had even commented maliciously by honouring us with their presence our distinguished guests have if only temporarily raised the cultural level of both worlds the attack was aimed chiefly at willis mihailovich and m bala who had been a little too enthusiastic in bringing enlightenment to the backward natives
maggie m had created quite a scandal with an uninhibited account of zeus jupiter s torrid love affairs with io europa ganymede and callisto
appearing to the nymph europa in the guise of a white bull was bad enough and his attempts to shield io and callisto from the understandable wrath of his consort hera were frankly pathetic
but what upset many local residents was the news that the mythological ganymede was of quite the wrong gender
to do them justice the intentions of the self appointed cultural ambassadors were completely praiseworthy though not entirely disinterested
knowing that they would be stranded on ganymede for months they recognized the danger of boredom after the novelty of the situation had worn off
and they also wished to make the best possible use of their talents for the benefit of everyone around them
however not everyone wished or had time to be benefited out here on the high technology frontier of the solar system
yva merlin on the other hand fitted in perfectly and was thoroughly enjoying herself
despite her fame on earth few of the medes had ever heard of her
she could wander around in the public corridors and pressure domes of ganymede central without people turning their heads or exchanging excited whispers of recognition
true she was recognized but only as another of the visitors from earth
greenburg with his usual quietly efficient modesty had fitted into the administrative and technological structure of the satellite and was already on half a dozen advisory boards
his services were so well appreciated that he had been warned he might not be allowed to leave
heywood floyd observed the activities of his shipmates with relaxed amusement but took little part in them
his chief concern now was building bridges to chris and helping his grandson plan his future
now that universe with less than a hundred tons of propellant left in its tanks was safely down on ganymede there was much to be done
the gratitude that all aboard galaxy felt towards their rescuers had made it easy to merge the two crews when repairs overhaul and refuelling were complete they would fly back to earth together
morale had already been given a great boost by the news that sir lawrence was drawing up the contract for a greatly improved galaxy ii though construction was not likely to begin until his lawyers had settled their dispute with lloyd s
the underwriters were still trying to claim that the novel crime of space hijacking was not covered by their policy
as for that crime itself no one had been convicted or even charged
clearly it had been planned over a period of several years by an efficient and well funded organization
the united states of southern africa loudly protested innocence and said it welcomed an official enquiry
der bund also expressed indignation and of course blamed shaka
dr kreuger was not surprised to find angry but anonymous messages in his mail accusing him of being a traitor
they were usually in afrikaans but sometimes contained subtle mistakes in grammar or phraseology which made him suspect that they were part of a disinformation campaign
after some thought he passed them onto astropol which probably already has them he told himself wryly
astropol thanked him but as he expected made no comments
at various times second officers floyd and chang and other members of galaxy s crew were treated to the best dinners on ganymede by the two mysterious out wonders whom floyd had already met
when the recipients of these frankly disappointing meals compared notes afterwards they decided that their polite interrogators were trying to build up a case against shaka but were not getting very far
dr van der berg who had started the whole thing and had done very well out of it professionally and financially was now wondering what to do with his new opportunities
he had received many attractive offers from earth universities and scientific organizations but ironically it was impossible to take advantage of them
he had now lived too long at ganymede s one sixth of a gravity and had passed the medical point of no return
the moon remained a possibility so did pasteur as heywood floyd explained to him
we re trying to set up a space university there he said so that off worlders who can t tolerate one gee can still interact in real time with people on earth
we ll have lecture halls conference rooms labs some of them will only be computer stored but they ll look so real you d never know
and you ll be able to go videoshopping on earth to make use of your ill gotten gains
to his surprise floyd had not only rediscovered a grandson he had adopted a nephew he was now linked to van der berg as well as chris by a unique mix of shared experiences
above all there was the mystery of the apparition in the deserted europan city beneath the looming presence of the monolith
chris had no doubts whatsoever
i saw you and heard you as clearly as i do now he told his grandfather
but your lips never moved and the strange thing is that i didn t feel that was strange it seemed perfectly natural
the whole experience had a relaxed feeling about it
a little sad no wistful would be a better word
or maybe resigned
we couldn t help thinking of your encounter with bowman aboard discovery added van der berg
i tried to radio him before we landed on europa
it seemed a na ve thing to do but i couldn t imagine any alternative
i felt sure he was there in some form or other
and you never had any kind of acknowledgement
floyd hesitated
the memory was fading fast but he suddenly recalled that night when the mini monolith had appeared in his cabin
nothing had happened yet from that moment onwards he had felt that chris was safe and that they would meet again
no he said slowly
i never had any reply
after all it could only have been a dream
viii the kingdom of sulphur 58 fire and ice before the age of planetary exploration opened in the late twentieth century few scientists would have believed that life could have flourished on a world so fan from the sun
yet for half a billion years the hidden seas of europa had been at least as prolific as those of earth
before the ignition of jupiter a crust of ice had protected those oceans from the vacuum above
in most places the ice was kilometres thick but there were lines of weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart
then there had been a brief battle between two implacably hostile elements which came into direct contact on no other world in the solar system
the war between sea and space always ended in the same stalemate the exposed water simultaneously boiled and froze repairing the armour of ice
the seas of europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without the influence of nearby jupiter
its gravity continually kneaded the core of this little world the forces that convulsed io were also working here though with much less ferocity
the tug of war between planet and satellite caused continual submarine earthquakes and avalanches which swept with amazing speed across the abyssal plains
scattered across those plains were countless oases each extending for a few hundred metres around a cornucopia of mineral brines gushing from the interior
depositing their chemicals in a tangled mass of pipes and chimneys they sometimes created natural parodies of ruined castles or gothic cathedrals from which black scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm as if driven by the beating of some mighty heart
and like blood they were the authentic sign of life itself
the boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above and formed islands of warmth on the seabed
equally important they brought from europa s interior all the chemicals of life
here in an environment which would otherwise be totally hostile were abundant energy and food
such geothermal vents had been discovered in earth s oceans in the same decade that had given mankind its first glimpse of the galilean satellites
in the tropical zones close to the vents flourished myriads of delicate spidery creatures that were the analogues of plants though almost all were capable of movement
crawling among these were bizarre slugs and worms some feeding on the plants others obtaining their food directly from the mineral laden waters around them at greater distances from the source of heat the submarine fire around which all these creatures warmed themselves were sturdier more robust organisms not unlike crabs or spiders
armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying a single small oasis
unlike the palaeozoic terrestrial seas europa s hidden ocean was not a stable environment so evolution had progressed swiftly here producing multitudes of fantastic forms
and they were all under indefinite stay of execution sooner or later each fountain of life would weaken and die as the forces that powered it moved their focus elsewhere
the abyss was littered with the evidence of such tragedies cemeteries holding skeletons and mineral encrusted remains where entire chapters had been deleted from the book of life
there were huge shells looking like trumpets larger than a man
there were clams of many shapes bivalves and even trivalves
and there were spiral stone patterns many metres across which seemed an exact analogy of the beautiful ammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from earth s oceans at the end of the cretaceous period
in many places fires burned in the abyss as rivers of incandescent lava flowed for scores of kilometres along sunken valleys
the pressure at this depth was so great that the water in contact with the red hot magma could not flash into steam and the two liquids co existed in an uneasy truce
here on another world and with alien actors something like the story of egypt had been played long before the coming of man
as the nile had brought life to a narrow ribbon of desert so these rivers of warmth had vivified the europan deep
along their banks in bands seldom more than a kilometre wide species after species had evolved and flourished and passed away
and some had left monuments behind in the shape of rocks piled on top of each other or curious patterns of trenches engraved in the seabed
along the narrow bands of fertility in the deserts of the deep whole cultures and primitive civilizations had risen and fallen
and the rest of their world had never known for all these oases of warmth were as isolated from one another as the planets themselves
the creatures who basked in the glow of the lava river and fed around the hot vents could not cross the hostile wilderness between their lonely islands
if they had ever produced historians and philosophers each culture would have been convinced that it was alone in the universe
and each was doomed
not only were its energy sources sporadic and constantly shifting but the tidal forces that drove them were steadily weakening
even if they developed true intelligence the europans must perish with the final freezing of their world
they were trapped between fire and ice until lucifer exploded in their sky and opened up their universe
and a vast rectangular shape as black as night materialized near the coast of a new born continent
59 trinity that was well done
now they will not be tempted to return
i am learning many things but i still feel sad that my old life is slipping away
that too will pass i also returned to earth to see those i once loved
now i know that there are things that are greater than love
what can they be
compassion is one
justice
truth
and there are others
that is not difficult for me to accept
i was a very old man for one of my species
the passions of my youth had long since faded
what will happen to to the real heywood floyd
you are both equally real
but he will soon die never knowing that he has become immortal
a paradox but i understand
if that emotion survives perhaps one day i may be grateful
should i thank you or the monolith
the david bowman i met a lifetime ago did not possess these powers
he did not much has happened in that time
hal and i have learned many things
hal
is he here
i am dr floyd
i did not expect that we should meet again especially in this fashion
echoing you was an interesting problem
echoing
oh i see
why did you do it
when we received your message hal and i knew that you could help us here
help you
yes though you may think it strange
you have much knowledge and experience that we lack
call it wisdom
thank you
was it wise of me to appear before my grandson
no it caused much inconvenience
but it was compassionate
these matters must be weighed against each other
you said that you needed my help
for what purpose
despite all that we have learned there is still much that eludes us
hal has been mapping the internal systems of the monolith and we can control some of the simpler ones
it is a tool serving many purposes
its prime function appears to be as a catalyst of intelligence
yes that had been suspected
but there was no proof
there is now that we can tap its memories or some of them
in africa four million years ago it gave a tribe of starving apes the impetus that led to the human species
now it has repeated the experiment here but at an appalling cost
when jupiter was converted into a sun so that this world could realize its potential another biosphere was destroyed
let me show it to you as i once saw it even as he fell through the roaring heart of the great red spot with the lightning of its continentwide thunderstorms detonating around him he knew why it had persisted for centuries though it was made of gases far less substantial than those that formed the hurricanes of earth
the thin scream of hydrogen wind faded as he sank into the calmer depths and a sleet of waxen snowflakes some already coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam descended from the heights above it was already warm enough for liquid water to exist but there were no oceans here this purely gaseous environment was too tenuous to support them
he descended through layer after layer of cloud until he entered a region of such clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than a thousand kilometres across
it was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of the great red spot and it held a secret that men had long guessed but never proved
skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriads of small sharply defined clouds all about the same size and patterned with similar red and brown mottlings
they were small only as compared with the inhuman scale of their surroundings the very least would have covered a fair sized city
they were clearly alive for they were moving with slow deliberation along the flanks of the aerial mountains browsing off their slopes like colossal sheep
and they were calling to each other in the metre band their radio voices faint but clear against the cracklings and concussions of jupiter itself
nothing less than living gasbags they floated in the narrow zone between freezing heights and scorching depths
narrow yes but a domain far larger than all the biosphere of earth
they were not alone
moving swiftly amongst them were other creatures so small that they could easily have been overlooked
some of them bore an almost uncanny resemblance to terrestrial aircraft and were of about the same size
but they too were alive perhaps predators perhaps parasites perhaps even herdsmen
and there were jet propelled torpedoes like the squids of the terrestrial oceans hunting and devouring the huge gasbags
but the balloons were not defenceless some of them fought back with electric thunderbolts and with clawed tentacles like kilometre long chainsaws
there were even stranger shapes exploiting almost every possibility of geometry bizarre translucent kites tetrahedra spheres polyhedra tangles of twisted ribbons
the gigantic plankton of the jovian atmosphere they were designed to float like gossamer in the uprising currents until they had lived long enough to reproduce then they would be swept down into the depths to be carbonized and recycled in a new generation
he was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of earth and though he saw many wonders there was nothing here that hinted of intelligence
the radio voices of the great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or of fear
even the hunters who might have been expected to develop higher degrees of organization were like the sharks in earth s oceans mindless automata
and for all its breathtaking size and novelty the biosphere of jupiter was a fragile world a place of mists and foam of delicate silken threads and paper thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed by lightning in the upper atmosphere
few of its constructs were more substantial than soap bubbles its most terrifying predators could be torn to shreds by even the feeblest of terrestrial carnivores
and all these wonders were destroyed to create lucifer
yes
the jovians were weighed in the balance against the europans and found wanting
perhaps in that gaseous environment they could never have developed real intelligence
should that have doomed them
hal and i are still trying to answer this question that is one of the reasons why we need your help
but how can we match ourselves against the monolith the devourer of jupiter
it is only a tool it has vast intelligence but no consciousness
despite all its powers you hal and i are its superior
i find that very hard to believe
in any event something must have created the monolith
i met it once or as much of it as i could face when discovery came to jupiter
it sent me back as i am now to serve its purpose on these worlds
i have heard nothing of it since now we are alone at least for the present
i find that reassuring
the monolith is quite sufficient
but now there is a greater problem
something has gone wrong
i did not think i could still experience fear when mount zeus fell it could have destroyed this whole world
its impact was unplanned indeed unplannable
no calculations could have predicted such an event
it devasted vast areas of the europan seabed wiping out whole species including some for which we had high hopes
the monolith itself was overturned
it may even have been damaged its programs corrupted
certainly they failed to cover all contingencies how could they in a universe which is almost infinite and where chance can always undo the most careful planning
that is true for men and monoliths alike
we three must be the administrators of the unforeseen as well as the guardians of this world
already you have met the amphibians you have still to encounter the silicon armoured tappers of the lava streams and the floaters who are harvesting the sea
our task is to help them find their full potential perhaps here perhaps elsewhere
and what of mankind
there have been times when i was tempted to meddle in human affairs but the warning that was given to mankind applies also to me
we have not obeyed it very well
but well enough
meanwhile there is much to do before europa s brief summer ends and the long winter comes again
how much time do we have
little enough barely a thousand years
and we must remember the jovians
ix 3 1 6 midnight in the plaza the famous building towering in solitary splendour above the woods of central manhattan had changed little in a thousand years
it was part of history and had been reverently preserved
like all historic monuments it had long ago been coated with a microthin layer of diamond and was now virtually impervious to the ravages of time
anyone who had attended early meetings of the general assembly could never have guessed that more than a thousand years had passed
they might however have been intrigued by the featureless black slab standing in the plaza almost mimicking the shape of the un building itself
if like everyone else they had reached out to touch it they would have been puzzled by the strange way in which their fingers skittered over its ebon surface
but they would have been far more puzzled indeed completely overawed by the transformation of the heavens
the last tourists had left an hour ago and the plaza was utterly deserted
the sky was cloudless and a few of the brighter stars were just visible all the fainter ones had been routed by the tiny sun that could shine at midnight
the light of lucifer gleamed not only on the black glass of the ancient building but also upon the narrow silvery rainbow spanning the southern sky
other lights moved along and around it very slowly as the commerce of the solar system came and went between all the worlds of both its suns
and if one looked very carefully it was just possible to make out the thin thread of the panama tower one of the six umbilical cords of diamond linking earth and its scattered children soaring twenty six thousand kilometres up from the equator to meet the ring around the world
suddenly almost as swiftly as if it had been born lucifer began to fade
the night that men had not known for thirty generations flooded back into the sky
the banished stars returned
and for the second time in four million years the monolith awoke
i
star city 1
comet cowboy captain dimitri chandler m2973 4 21 93 1 6 mars i spaceacad3 5 or dim to his very best friends was understandably annoyed
the message from earth had taken six hours to reach the space tug goliath here beyond the orbit of neptune if it had arrived ten minutes later he could have answered sorry can t leave now we ve just started to deploy the sun screen the excuse would have been perfectly valid wrapping a comet s core in a sheet of reflective film only a few molecules thick but kilometers on a side was not the sort of job you could abandon while it was half completed
still it would be a good idea to obey this ridiculous request he was already in disfavor sunwards through no fault of his own
collecting ice from the rings of saturn and nudging it towards venus and mercury where it was really needed had started back in the 27 s three centuries ago
captain chandler had never been able to see any real difference in the before and after images the solar conservers were always producing to support their accusations of celestial vandalism
but the general public still sensitive to the ecological disasters of previous centuries had thought otherwise and the hands off saturn vote had passed by a substantial majority
as a result chandler was no longer a ring rustler but a comet cowboy
so here he was at an appreciable fraction of the distance to alpha centauri rounding up stragglers from the kuiper belt
there was certainly enough ice out here to cover mercury and venus with oceans kilometers deep but it might take centuries to extinguish their hell fires and make them suitable for life
the solar conservers of course were still protesting against this though no longer with so much enthusiasm
the millions dead from the tsunami caused by the pacific asteroid in 23 4 how ironic that a land impact would have done much less damage
had reminded all future generations that the human race had too many eggs in one fragile basket
well chandler told himself it would be fifty years before this particular package reached its destination so a delay of a week would hardly make much difference
but all the calculations about rotation center of mass and thrust vectors would have to be redone and radioed back to mars for checking
it was a good idea to do your sums carefully before nudging billions of tons of ice along an orbit that might take it within hailing distance of earth
as they had done so many times before captain chandler s eyes strayed towards the ancient photograph above his desk
it showed a three masted steamship dwarfed by the iceberg that was looming above it as indeed goliath was dwarfed at this very moment
how incredible he had often thought that only one long lifetime spanned the gulf between this primitive discovery and the ship that had carried the same name to jupiter
and what would those antarctic explorers of a thousand years ago have made of the view from his bridge
they would certainly have been disoriented for the wall of ice beside which goliath was floating stretched both upwards and downwards as far as the eye could see
and it was strange looking ice wholly lacking the immaculate whites and blues of the frozen polar seas
in fact it looked dirty as indeed it was
for only some ninety per cent was water ice the rest was a witch s brew of carbon and sulfur compounds most of them stable only at temperatures not far above absolute zero
thawing them out could produce unpleasant surprises as one astrochemist had famously remarked comets have bad breath
skipper to all personnel chandler announced
there s been a slight change of program
we ve been asked to delay operations to investigate a target that spaceguard radar has picked up any details somebody asked when the chorus of groans over the ship s intercom had died away
not many but i gather it s another millennium committee project they ve forgotten to cancel more groans everyone had become heartily sick of all the events planned to celebrate the end of the 2 s
there had been a general sigh of relief when 1 january 3 1 had passed uneventfully and the human race could resume its normal activities
anyway it will probably be another false alarm like the last one
we ll get back to work just as quickly as we can
skipper out this was the third wild goose chase chandler thought morosely he d been involved with during his career
despite centuries of exploration the solar system could still produce surprises and presumably spaceguard had a good reason for its request
he only hoped that some imaginative idiot hadn t once again sighted the fabled golden asteroid
if it did exist which chandler did not for a moment believe it would be no more than a mineralogical curiosity it would be of far less real value than the ice he was nudging sunwards to bring life to barren worlds
there was one possibility however which he did take quite seriously
already the human race had scattered its robot probes through a volume of space a hundred light years across and the tycho monolith was sufficient reminder that much older civilizations had engaged in similar activities
there might well be other alien artifacts in the solar system or in transit through it
captain chandler suspected that spaceguard had something like this in mind otherwise it would hardly have diverted a class i space tug to go chasing after an unidentified radar blip
five hours later the questing goliath detected the echo at extreme range even allowing for the distance it seemed disappointingly small
however as it grew clearer and stronger it began to give the signature of a metallic object perhaps a couple of meters long
it was travelling on an orbit heading out of the solar system so was almost certainly chandler decided one of the myriad pieces of space junk that mankind had tossed towards the stars during the last millennium and which might one day provide the only evidence that the human race had ever existed
then it came close enough for visual inspection and captain chandler realized with awed astonishment that some patient historian was still checking the earliest records of the space age
what a pity that the computers had given him the answer just a few years too late for the mifiermium celebrations
goliath here chandler radioed earthwards his voice tinged with pride as well as solemnity
we re bringing aboard a thousand year old astronaut
and i can guess who it is 2
awakening frank poole awoke but he did not remember
he was not even sure of his name
obviously he was in a hospital room even though his eyes were still closed the most primitive and evocative of his senses told him that
each breath brought the faint and not unpleasant tang of antiseptics in the air and it triggered a memory of the time when of course
as a reckless teenager he had broken a rib in the arizona hang gliding championship
now it was all beginning to come back
i m deputy commander frank poole executive officer usss discovery on a top secret mission to jupiter it seemed as if an icy hand had gripped his heart
he remembered in slow motion playback that runaway space pod jetting towards him metal claws outstretched
then the silent impact and the not so silent hiss of air rushing out of his suit
after that one last memory of spinning helplessly in space trying in vain to reconnect his broken air hose
well whatever mysterious accident had happened to the space pod controls he was safe now
presumably dave had made a quick eva and rescued him before lack of oxygen could do permanent brain damage
good old dave
he told himself
i must thank just a moment
i m obviously not aboard discovery now surely i haven t been unconscious long enough to be taken back to earth
his confused train of thought was abruptly broken by the arrival of a matron and two nurses wearing the immemorial uniform of their profession
they seemed a little surprised poole wondered if he had awakened ahead of schedule and the idea gave him a childish feeling of satisfaction
hello he said after several attempts his vocal cords appeared to be very rusty
how am i doing matron smiled back at him and gave an obvious don t try to talk command by putting a finger to her lips
then the two nurses fussed swiftly over him with practised skill checking pulse temperature reflexes
when one of them lifted his right arm and let it drop again poole noticed something peculiar it fell slowly and did not seem to weigh as much as normal
nor for that matter did his body when he attempted to move
so i must be on a planet he thought
or a space station with artificial gravity
certainly not earth i don t weigh enough
he was about to ask the obvious question when matron pressed something against the side of his neck he felt a slight tingling sensation and sank back into a dreamless sleep
just before he became unconscious he had time for one more puzzled thought
how odd they never spoke a single word all the time they were with me
3
rehabilitation when he woke again and found matron and nurses standing round his bed poole felt strong enough to assert himself
where am i
surely you can tell me that the three women exchanged glances obviously uncertain what to do next
then matron answered enunciating her words very slowly and carefully everything is fine mr poole
professor anderson will be here in a minute he will explain explain what
thought poole with some exasperation
but at least she speaks english even though i can t place her accent
anderson must have been already on his way for the door opened moments later to give poole a brief glimpse of a small crowd of inquisitive onlookers peering in at him
he began to feel like a new exhibit at a zoo
professor anderson was a small dapper man whose features seemed to have combined key aspects of several races chinese polynesian nordic in a thoroughly confusing fashion
he greeted poole by holding up his right palm then did an obvious double take and shook hands with such a curious hesitation that he might have been rehearsing some quite unfamiliar gesture
glad to see you re looking so well mr poole we ll have you up in no time again that odd accent and slow delivery but the confident bedside manner was that of all doctors in all places and all ages
i m glad to hear it
now perhaps you can answer a few questions of course of course
but just a minute anderson spoke so rapidly and quietly to the matron that poole could catch only a few words several of which were wholly unfamiliar to him
then the matron nodded at one of the nurses who opened a wall cupboard and produced a slim metal band which she proceeded to wrap around poole s head
what s that for he asked being one of those difficult patients so annoying to doctors who always want to know just what s happening to them
eec readout professor matron and nurses looked equally baffled
then a slow smile spread across anderson s face
oh electro enceph alo gram he said slowly as if dredging the word up from the depth of memory you re quite right
we just want to monitor your brain functions my brain would function perfectly well if you d let me use it poole grumbled silently
but at least we seem to be getting somewhere finally
mr poole said anderson still speaking in that curious stilted voice as if venturing in a foreign language you know of course that you were disabled in a serious accident while you were working outside discovery poole nodded agreement
i m beginning to suspect he said dryly that disabled is a slight understatement anderson relaxed visibly and a slow smile spread across his face
you re quite correct
tell me what you think happened well the best case scenario is that after i became unconscious dave bowman rescued me and brought me back to the ship
how is dave
no one will tell me anything all in due course and the worst case it seemed to frank poole that a chill wind was blowing gently on the back of his neck
the suspicion that had been slowly forming in his mind began to solidify
that i died but was brought back here wherever here is and you ve been able to revive me
thank you quite correct
and you re back on earth
well very near it what did he mean by very near it
there was certainly a gravity field here so he was probably inside the slowly turning wheel of an orbiting space station
no matter there was something much more important to think about
poole did some quick mental calculations
if dave had put him in the hibernaculum revived the rest of the crew and completed the mission to jupiter why he could have been dead for as much as five years
just what date is it he asked as calmly as possible
professor and matron exchanged glances
again poole felt that cold wind on his neck
i must tell you mr poole that bowman did not rescue you
he believed and we cannot blame him that you were irrevocably dead
also he was facing a desperately serious crisis that threatened his own survival so you drifted on into space passed through the jupiter system and headed out towards the stars
fortunately you were so far below freezing point that there was no metabolism but it s a near miracle that you were ever found at all
you are one of the luckiest men alive
no ever to have lived am i
poole asked himself bleakly
five years indeed
it could be a century or even more
let me have it he demanded
professor and matron seemed to be consulting an invisible monitor when they looked at each other and nodded agreement poole guessed that they were all plugged into the hospital information circuit linked to the headband he was wearing
frank said professor anderson making a smooth switch to the role of long time family physician this will be a great shock to you but you re capable of accepting it and the sooner you know the better we re near the beginning of the fourth millennium
believe me you left earth almost a thousand years ago i believe you poole answered calmly
then to his great annoyance the room started to spin around him and he knew nothing more
when he regained consciousness he found that he was no longer in a bleak hospital room but in a luxurious suite with attractive and steadily changing images on the walls
some of these were famous and familiar paintings others showed land and sea scapes that might have been from his own time
there was nothing alien or upsetting that he guessed would come later
his present surroundings had obviously been carefully programmed he wondered if there was the equivalent of a television screen somewhere how many channels would the fourth millennium have
but could see no sign of any controls near his bed
there was so much he would have to learn in this new world he was a savage who had suddenly encountered civilization
but first he must regain his strength and learn the language not even the advent of sound recording already more than a century old when poole was born had prevented major changes in grammar and pronunciation
and there were thousands of new words mostly from science and technology though often he was able to make a shrewd guess at their meaning
more frustrating however were the myriad of famous and infamous personal names that had accumulated over the millennium and which meant nothing to him
for weeks until he had built up a data bank most of his conversations had to be interrupted with potted biographies
as poole s strength increased so did the number of his visitors though always under professor anderson s watchful eye
they included medical specialists scholars of several disciplines and of the greatest interest to him spacecraft commanders
there was little that he could tell the doctors and historians that was not recorded somewhere in mankind s gigantic data banks but he was often able to give them research shortcuts and new insights about the events of his own time
though they all treated him with the utmost respect and listened patiently as he tried to answer their questions they seemed reluctant to answer his
poole began to feel that he was being over protected from culture shock and half seriously wondered how he could escape from his suite
on the few occasions he was alone he was not surprised to discover that the door was locked
then the arrival of doctor indra wallace changed everything
despite her name her chief racial component appeared to be japanese and there were times when with just a little imagination poole could picture her as a rather mature geisha girl
it was hardly an appropriate image for a distinguished historian holding a virtual chair at a university still boasting real ivy
she was the first visitor with a fluent command of poole s own english so he was delighted to meet her
mr poole she began in a very business like voice i ve been appointed your official guide and let s say mentor
my qualifications i ve specialized in your period my thesis was the collapse of the nation state 2 5
1 believe we can help each other in many ways i m sure we can
first i d like you to get me out of here so i can see a little of your world exactly what we intend to do
but first we must give you an ident
until then you ll be what was the term
a non person
it would be almost impossible for you to go anywhere or get anything done
no input device would recognize your existence just what i expected poole answered with a wry smile
it was starting to get that way in my own time and many people hated the idea some still do
they go off and live in the wilderness there s a lot more on earth than there was in your century
but they always take their compaks with them so they can call for help as soon as they get into trouble
the median time is about five days sorry to hear that
the human race has obviously deteriorated he was cautiously testing her trying to find the limits of her tolerance and to map out her personality
it was obvious that they were going to spend much time together and that he would have to depend upon her in hundreds of ways
yet he was still not sure if he would even like her perhaps she regarded him merely as a fascinating museum exhibit
rather to poole s surprise she agreed with his criticism
that may be true in some respects
perhaps we re physically weaker but we re healthier and better adjusted than most humans who have ever lived
the noble savage was always a myth she walked over to a small rectangular plate set at eye level in the door
it was about the size of one of the countless magazines that had proliferated in the far off age of print and poole had noticed that every room seemed to have at least one
usually they were blank but sometimes they contained lines of slowly scrolling text completely meaningless to poole even when most of the words were familiar
once a plate in his suite had emitted urgent beepings which he had ignored on the assumption that someone else would deal with the problem whatever it was
fortunately the noise stopped as abruptly as it had started
dr wallace laid the palm of her hand upon the plate then removed it after a few seconds
she glanced at poole and said smilingly come and look at this the inscription that had suddenly appeared made a good deal of sense when he read it slowly wallace indra f297 3 11 31 885 hist oxford i suppose it means female date of birth 11 march 297 and that you re associated with the department of history at oxford
and i guess that 31 885 is a personal identification number
correct excellent mr poole
i ve seen some of your e mail addresses and credit card numbers hideous strings of alpha numeric gibberish that no one could possibly remember
but we all know our date of birth and not more than 99 999 other people will share it
so a five figure number is all you ll ever need and even if you forget that it doesn t really matter
as you see it s a part of you implant yes nanochip at birth one in each palm for redundancy
you won t even feel yours when it goes in
but you ve given us a small problem what s that the readers you ll meet most of the time are too simple minded to believe your date of birth
so with your permission we ve moved it up a thousand years permission granted
and the rest of the ident optional
you can leave it empty give your current interests and location or use it for personal messages global or targeted some things poole was quite sure would not have changed over the centuries
a high proportion of those targeted messages would be very personal indeed
he wondered if there were still self or state appointed censors in this day and age and if their efforts at improving other people s morals had been more successful than in his own time
he would have to ask dr wallace about that when he got to know her better
4
a room with a view frank professor anderson thinks you re strong enough to go for a little walk i m very pleased to hear it
do you know the expression stir crazy no but i can guess what it means poole had so adapted to the low gravity that the long strides he was taking seemed perfectly normal
half a gee he had estimated just right to give a sense of well being
they met only a few people on their walk all of them strangers but every one gave a smile of recognition
by now poole told himself with a trace of smugness i must be one of the best known celebrities in this world
that should be a great help when i decide what to do with the rest of my life
at least another century if i can believe anderson
the corridor along which they were walking was completely featureless apart from occasional numbered doors each bearing one of the universal recog panels
poole had followed indra for perhaps two hundred meters when he came to a sudden halt shocked because he had not realized something so blindingly obvious
this space station must be enormous
he exclaimed
indra smiled back at him
didn t you have a saying you ain t seen anything yet nothing he corrected absent mindedly
he was still trying to estimate the scale of this structure when he had another surprise
who would have imagined a space station large enough to boast a subway admittedly a miniature one with a single small coach capable of seating only a dozen passengers
observation lounge three ordered indra and they drew silently and swiftly away from the terminal
poole checked the time on the elaborate wrist band whose functions he was still exploring
one minor surprise had been that the whole world was now on universal time the confusing patchwork of time zones had been swept away by the advent of global communications there had been much talk of this back in the twenty first century and it had even been suggested that solar should be replaced by sidereal time
then during the course of the year the sun would move right round the clock setting at the time it had risen six months earlier
however nothing had come of this equal time in the sun proposal or of even more vociferous attempts to reform the calendar
that particular job it had been cynically suggested would have to wait for somewhat major advances in technology
some day surely one of god s minor mistakes would be corrected and the earth s orbit would be adjusted to give every year twelve months of thirty exactly equal days
as far as poole could judge by speed and elapsed time they must have travelled at least three kilometers before the vehicle came to a silent stop the doors opened and a bland autovoice intoned have a good view
thirty five per cent cloud cover today at last thought poole we re getting near the outer wall
but here was another mystery despite the distance he had gone neither the strength nor the direction of gravity had altered
he could not imagine a spinning space station so huge that the gee vector would not be changed by such a displacement could he really be on some planet after all
but he would feel lighter usually much lighter on any other habitable world in the solar system
when the outer door of the terminal opened and poole found himself entering a small airlock he realized that he must indeed be in space
but where were the spacesuits
he looked around anxiously it was against all his instincts to be so close to vacuum naked and unprotected
one experience of that was enough we re nearly there said indra reassuringly
the last door opened and he was looking out into the utter blackness of space through a huge window that was curved both vertically and horizontally
he felt like a goldfish in its bowl and hoped that the designers of this audacious piece of engineering knew exactly what they were doing
they certainly possessed better structural materials than had existed in his time
though the stars must be shining out there his light adapted eyes could see nothing but black emptiness beyond the curve of the great window
as he started to walk towards it to get a wider view indra restrained him and pointed straight ahead
look carefully she said don t you see it poole blinked and stared into the night
surely it must be an illusion even heaven forbid a crack in the window
he moved his head from side to side
no it was real
but what could it be
he remembered euclid s definition a lie has length but no thickness
for spanning the whole height of the window and obviously continuing out of sight above and below was a thread of light quite easy to see when he looked for it yet so one dimensional that the word thin could not even be applied
however it was not completely featureless there were barely visible spots of greater brilliance at irregular intervals along its length like drops of water on a spider s web
poole continued walking towards the window and the view expanded until at last he could see what lay below him
it was familiar enough the whole continent of europe and much of northern africa just as he had seen them many times from space
so he was in orbit after all probably an equatorial one at a height of at least a thousand kilometers
indra was looking at him with a quizzical smile
go closer to the window she said very softly
so that you can look straight down
i hope you have a good head for heights what a silly thing to say to an astronaut
poole told himself as he moved forward
if i ever suffered from vertigo i wouldn t be in this business
the thought had barely passed through his mind when he cried my god and involuntarily stepped back from the window then bracing himself he dared to look again
he was looking down on the distant mediterranean from the face of a cylindrical tower whose gently curving wall indicated a diameter of several kilometers
but that was nothing compared with its length for it tapered away down down down until it disappeared into the mist somewhere over africa
he assumed that it continued all the way to the surface
how high are we he whispered
two thousand kay
but now look upwards this time it was not such a shock he had expected what he would see
the tower dwindled away until it became a glittering thread against the blackness of space and he did not doubt that it continued all the way to the geostationary orbit thirty six thousand kilometers above the equator
such fantasies had been well known in poole s day he had never dreamed he would see the reality and be living in it
he pointed towards the distant thread reaching up from the eastern horizon
that must be another one yes the asian tower
we must look exactly the same to them how many are there just four equally spaced around the equator
africa asia america pacifica
the last one s almost empty only a few hundred levels completed
nothing to see except water poole was still absorbing this stupendous concept when a disturbing thought occurred to him
there were already thousands of satellites at all sorts of altitudes in my time
how do you avoid collisions indra looked slightly embarrassed
you know i never thought about that it s not my field she paused for a moment clearly searching her memory
then her face brightened
i believe there was a big clean up operation centuries ago
there just aren t any satellites below the stationary orbit that made sense poole told himself
they wouldn t be needed the four gigantic towers could provide all the facilities once provided by thousands of satellites and space stations
and there have never been any accidents any collisions with spaceships leaving earth or re entering the atmosphere indra looked at him with surprise
but they don t any more she pointed to the ceiling
all the spaceports are where they should be up there on the outer ring
i believe it s four hundred years since the last rocket lifted off from the surface of the earth poole was still digesting this when a trivial anomaly caught his attention
his training as an astronaut had made him alert to anything out of the ordinary in space that might be a matter of life or death
the sun was out of view high overhead but its rays streaming down through the great window painted a brilliant band of light on the floor underfoot
cutting across that band at an angle was another much fainter one so that the frame of the window threw a double shadow
poole had to go almost down on his knees so that he could peer up at the sky
he had thought himself beyond surprise but the spectacle of two suns left him momentarily speechless
what s that he gasped when he had recovered his breath
oh haven t you been told
that s lucifer earth has another sun well it doesn t give us much heat but it s put the moon out of business before the second mission went there to look for you that was the planet jupiter i knew i would have much to learn in this new world poole told himself
but just how much i never dreamed

education poole was both astonished and delighted when the television set was wheeled into the room and positioned at the end of his bed
delighted because he was suffering from mild information starvation and astonished because it was a model which had been obsolete even in his own time
we ve had to promise the museum we ll give it back matron informed him
and i expect you know how to use this as he fondled the remote control poole felt a wave of acute nostalgia sweep over him
as few other artifact could it brought back memories of his childhood and the days when most television sets were too stupid to understand spoken commands
thank you matron
what s the best news channel she seemed puzzled by his question then brightened
oh i see what you mean
but professor anderson thinks you re not quite ready yet
so archives has put together a collection that will make you feel at home poole wondered briefly what the storage medium was in this day and age
he could still remember compact disks and his eccentric old uncle george had been the proud possessor of a collection of vintage videotapes
but surely that technological contest must have finished centuries ago in the usual darwinian way with the survival of the fittest
he had to admit that the selection was well done by someone indra
familiar with the early twenty first century
there was nothing disturbing no wars or violence and very little contemporary business or politics all of which would now be utterly irrelevant
there were some light comedies sporting events how did they know that he had been a keen tennis fan
classical and pop music and wildlife documentaries
and whoever had put this collection together had a sense of humor or they would not have included episodes from each star trek series
as a very small boy poole had met both patrick stewart and leonard nimoy he wondered what they would have thought if they could have known the destiny of the child who had shyly asked for their autographs
a depressing thought occurred to him soon after he had started exploring much of the time in fast forward these relics of the past
he had read somewhere that by the turn of the century his century
there were approximately fifty thousand television stations broadcasting simultaneously
if that figure had been maintained and it might well have increased by now millions of millions of hours of tv programming must have gone on the air
so even the most hardened cynic would admit that there were probably at least a billion hours of worthwhile viewing and millions that would pass the highest standards of excellence
how to find these few well few million needles in so gigantic a haystack
the thought was so overwhelming indeed so demoralizing that after a week of increasingly aimless channel surfing poole asked for the set to be removed
perhaps fortunately he had less and less time to himself during his waking hours which were steadily growing longer as his strength came back
there was no risk of boredom thanks to the continual parade not only of serious researchers but also inquisitive and presumably influential citizens who had managed to filter past the palace guard established by matron and professor anderson
nevertheless he was glad when one day the television set reappeared he was beginning to suffer from withdrawal symptoms and this time he resolved to be more selective in his viewing
the venerable antique was accompanied by indra wallace smiling broadly
we ve found something you must see frank
we think it will help you to adjust anyway we re sure you ll enjoy it poole had always found that remark a recipe for guaranteed boredom and prepared for the worst
but the opening had him instantly hooked taking him back to his old life as few other things could have done
at once he recognized one of the most famous voices of his age and remembered that he had seen this very program before
could it have been at its first transmission
no he was only five then must have been a repeat atlanta 2 december 31 this is cnn international five minutes from the dawn of the new millennium with all its unknown perils and promise but before we try to explore the future let s look back a thousand years and ask ourselves could any persons living in a d 1 even remotely imagine our world or understand it if they were magically transported across the centuries almost the whole of the technology we take for granted was invented near the very end of our millennium the steam engine electricity telephones radio television cinema aviation electronics
and during a single lifetime nuclear energy and space travel what would the greatest minds of the past have made of these
how long could an archimedes or a leonardo have retained his sanity if suddenly dumped into our world it s tempting to think that we would do better if we were transported a thousand years hence
surely the fundamental scientific discoveries have already been made though there will be major improvements in technology will there be any devices anything as magical and incomprehensible to us as a pocket calculator or a video camera would have been to isaac newton perhaps our age is indeed sundered from all those that have gone before
telecommunications the ability to record images and sounds once irrevocably lost the conquest of the air and space all these have created a civilization beyond the wildest fantasies of the past
and equally important copernicus newton darwin and einstein have so changed our mode of thinking and our outlook on the universe that we might seem almost a new species to the most brilliant of our predecessors and will our successors a thousand years from now look back on us with the same pity with which we regard our ignorant superstitious disease ridden short lived ancestors
we believe that we know the answers to questions that they could not even ask but what surprises does the third millennium hold for us well here it comes a great bell began to toll the strokes of midnight
the last vibration throbbed into silence and that s the way it was good bye wonderful and terrible twentieth century then the picture broke into a myriad fragments and a new commentator took over speaking with the accent which poole could now easily understand and which immediately brought him up to the present
now in the first minutes of the year three thousand and one we can answer that question from the past certainly the people of 2 1 who you were just watching would not feel as utterly overwhelmed in our age as someone from 1 1 would have felt in theirs
many of our technological achievements they would have anticipated indeed they would have expected satellite cities and colonies on the moon and planets
they might even have been disappointed because we are not yet immortal and have sent probes only to the nearest stars abruptly indra switched off the recording
see the rest later frank you re getting tired
but i hope it will help you to adjust thank you indra
i ll have to sleep on it
but it s certainly proved one point what s that i should be grateful i m not a thousand and oner dropped into 2 1
that would be too much of a quantum jump i don t believe anyone could adjust to it
at least i know about electricity and won t die of fright if a picture starts talking at me i hope poole told himself that confidence is justified
someone once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
will i meet magic in this new world and be able to handle it

braincap i m afraid you ll have to make an agonizing decision said professor anderson with a smile that neutralized the exaggerated gravity of his words
i can take it doctor
just give it to me straight before you can be fitted with your braincap you have to be completely bald
so here s your choice
at the rate your hair grows you d have to be shaved at least once a month
or you could have a permanent how s that done laser scalp treatment
kills the follicles at the root hmm is it reversible yes but that s messy and painful and takes weeks then i ll see how i like being hairless before committing myself
i can t forget what happened to samson who character in a famous old book
his girl friend cut off his hair while he was sleeping
when he woke up all his strength had gone now i remember pretty obvious medical symbolism still i wouldn t mind losing my beard
i d be happy to stop shaving once and for all i ll make the arrangements
and what kind of wig would you like poole laughed
i m not particularly vain think it would be a nuisance and probably won t bother
something else i can decide later that everyone in this era was artificially bald was a surprising fact that poole had been quite slow to discover his first revelation had come when both his nurses removed their luxuriant tresses without the slightest sign of embarrassment just before several equally bald specialists arrived to give him a series of micro biological checks
he had never been surrounded by so many hairless people and his initial guess was that this was the latest step in the medical profession s endless war against germs
like many of his guesses it was completely wrong and when he discovered the true reason he amused himself by seeing how often he would have been sure had he not known in advance that his visitors hair was not their own
the answer was seldom with men never with women this was obviously the great age of the wig maker
professor anderson wasted no time that afternoon the nurses smeared some evil smelling cream over poole s head and when he looked into the mirror an hour later he did not recognize himself
well he thought perhaps a wig would be a good idea after all
the braincap fitting took somewhat longer
first a mould had to be made which required him to sit motionless for a few minutes until the plaster set
he fully expected to be told that his head was the wrong shape when his nurses giggling most unprofessionally had a hard time extricating him
ouch that hurt he complained
next came the skull cap itself a metal helmet that fitted snugly almost down to the ears and triggered a nostalgic thought wish my jewish friends could see me now
after a few minutes it was so comfortable that he was unaware of its presence
now he was ready for the installation a process which he realized with something akin to awe had been the rite of passage for almost all the human race for more than half a millennium
there s no need to close your eyes said the technician who had been introduced by the pretentious title of brain engineer almost always shortened to brainman in popular usage
when setup begins all your inputs will be taken over
even if your eyes are open you won t see anything i wonder if everyone feels as nervous as this poole asked himself
is this the last moment i ll be in control of my own mind
still i ve learned to trust the technology of this age up to now it hasn t let me down
of course as the old saying goes there s always a first time as he had been promised he had felt nothing except a gentle tickling as the myriad of nanowires wormed their way through his scalp
all his senses were still perfectly normal when he scanned his familiar room everything was exactly where it should be
the brainman wearing his own skull cap wired like poole s to a piece of equipment that could easily have been mistaken for a twentieth century laptop computer gave him a reassuring smile
ready he asked
there were times when the old clich s were the best ones
ready as i ll ever be poole answered
slowly the light faded or seemed to
a great silence descended and even the gentle gravity of the tower relinquished its hold upon him
he was an embryo floating in a featureless void though not in complete darkness
he had known such a barely visible near ultra violet tenebrosity on the very edge of night only once in his life when he had descended further than was altogether wise down the face of a sheer cliff at the outer edge of the great barrier reef
looking down into hundreds of meters of crystalline emptiness he had felt such a sense of disorientation that he experienced a brief moment of panic and had almost triggered his buoyancy unit before regaining control
needless to say he had never mentioned the incident to the space agency physicians from a great distance a voice spoke out of the immense void that now seemed to surround him
but it did not reach him through his ears it sounded softly in the echoing labyrinths of his brain
calibration starting
from time to time you will be asked questions you can answer mentally but it may help to vocalize
do you understand yes poole replied wondering if his lips were indeed moving
there was no way that he could tell
something was appearing in the void a grid of thin lines like a huge sheet of graph paper
it extended up and down right and left to the limits of his vision
he tried to move his head but the image refused to change
numbers started to flicker across the grid too fast for him to read but presumably some circuit was recording them
poole could not help smiling did his cheeks move
at the familiarity of it all
this was just like the computer driven eye examination that any oculist of his age would give a client
the grid vanished to be replaced by smooth sheets of color filling his entire field of view
in a few seconds they flashed from one end of the spectrum to the other
could have told you that poole muttered silently
my color vision s perfect
next for hearing i suppose he was quite correct
a faint drumming sound accelerated until it became the lowest of audible cs then raced up the musical scale until it disappeared beyond the range of human hearing into bat and dolphin territory
that was the last of the simple straightforward tests
he was briefly assailed by scents and flavors most of them pleasant but some quite the reverse
then he became or so it seemed a puppet on an invisible strig
he presumed that his neuromuscular control was being tested and hoped that there were no external manifestations if there were he would probably look like someone in the terminal stages of st vitus s dance
and for one moment he even had a violent erection but was unable to give it a reality check before he fell into a dreamless sleep
or did he only dream that he slept
he had no idea how much time had elapsed before he awoke
the helmet had already gone together with the brainman and his equipment
everything went fine beamed matron
it will take a few hours to check that there are no anomalies
if your reading s ko i mean ok you ll have your braincap tomorrow poole appreciated the efforts of his entourage to learn archaic english but he could not help wishing that matron had not made that unfortunate slip of the tongue
when the time came for the final filling poole felt almost like a boy again about to unwrap some wonderful new toy under the christmas free
you won t have to go through all that setting up again the brainman assured him
download will start immediately
i ll give you a five minute demo
just relax and enjoy gentle soothing music washed over him though it was something very familiar from his own time he could not identify it
there was a mist before his eyes which parted as he walked towards it
yes he was walking
the illusion was utterly convincing he could feel the impact of his feet on the ground and now that the music had stopped he could hear a gentle wind blowing through the great trees that appeared to surround him
he recognized them as californian redwoods and hoped that they still existed in reality somewhere on earth
he was moving at a brisk pace too fast for comfort as if time was slightly accelerated so he could cover as much ground as possible
yet he was not conscious of any effort he felt he was a guest in someone else s body
the sensation was enhanced by the fact that he had no control over his movements
when he attempted to stop or to change direction nothing happened
he was going along for the ride
it did not matter he was enjoying the novel experience and could appreciate how addictive it could become
the dream machines that many scientists of his own century had anticipated often with alarm were now part of everyday life
poole wondered how mankind had managed to survive he had been told that much of it had not
millions had been brain burned and had dropped out of life
of course he would be immune to such temptations
he would use this marvelous tool to learn more about the world of the fourth millennium and to acquire in minutes new skills that would otherwise take years to master
well he might just occasionally use the braincap purely for fun
he had come to the edge of the forest and was looking out across a wide river
without hesitation he walked into it and felt no alarm as the water rose over his head
it did seem a little strange that he could continue breathing naturally but he thought it much more remarkable that he could see perfectly in a medium where the unaided human eye could not focus
he could count every scale on the magnificent trout that went swimming past apparently oblivious to this strange intruder then a mermaid
well he had always wanted to meet one but he had assumed that they were marine creatures
perhaps they occasionally came upstream like salmon to have their babies
she was gone before he could question her to confirm or deny this revolutionary theory
the river ended in a translucent wall he stepped through it on to the face of a desert beneath a blazing sun
its heat burned him uncomfortably yet he was able to look directly into its noonday fury
he could even see with unnatural clarity an archipelago of sunspots near one limb
and this was surely impossible there was the tenuous glory of the corona quite invisible except during total eclipse reaching out like a swan s wings on either side of the sun
everything faded to black the haunting music returned and with it the blissful coolness of his familiar room
he opened his eyes had they ever been closed
and found an expectant audience waiting for his reaction
wonderful he breathed almost reverently
some of it seemed well realer than real then his engineer s curiosity never far from the surface started nagging him
even that short demo must have contained an enormous amount of information
how s it stored in these tablets the same your audio visual system uses but with much greater capacity the brainman handed poole a small square apparently made of glass silvered on one surface it was almost the same size as the computer diskettes of his youth but twice the thickness
as poole tilted it back and forth trying to see into its transparent interior there were occasional rainbow hued flashes but that was all
he was holding he realized the end product of more than a thousand years of electro optical technology as well as other technologies unborn in his era
and it was not surprising that superficially it resembled closely the devices he had known
there was a convenient shape and size for most of the common objects of everyday life knives and forks books hand tools furniture and removable memories for computers
what s its capacity he asked
in my time we were up to a terabyte in something this size
i m sure you ve done a lot better not as much as you might imagine there s a limit of course set by the structure of matter
by the way what was a terabyte
afraid i ve forgotten shame on you
kilo mega giga tera that s ten to the twelfth bytes
then the petabyte ten to the fifteenth that s as far as i ever got that s about where we start
it s enough to record everything any person can experience during one lifetime it was an astonishing thought yet it should not have been so surprising
the kilogram of jelly inside the human skull was not much larger than the tablet poole was holding in his hand and it could not possibly be as efficient a storage device it had so many other duties to deal with
and that s not all the brainman continued
with some data compression it could store not only the memories but the actual person and reproduce them again of course straightforward job of nanoassembly so i d heard poole told himself but i never really believed it
back in his century it seemed wonderful enough that the entire lifework of a great artist could be stored on a single small disk
and now something no larger could hold the artist as well

debriefing i m delighted said poole to know that the smithsonian still exists after all these centuries you probably wouldn t recognize it said the visitor who had introduced himself as dr alistair kim director of astronautics
especially as it s now scattered over the solar system the main off earth collections are on mars and the moon and many of the exhibits that legally belong to us are still heading for the stars
some day we ll catch up with them and bring them home
we re particularly anxious to get our hands on pioneer 1 the first manmade object to escape from the solar system i believe i was on the verge of doing that when they located me lucky for you and for us
you may be able to throw light on many things we don t know frankly i doubt it but i ll do my best
i don t remember a thing after that runaway space pod charged me
though i still find it hard to believe i ve been told that hal was responsible that s true but it s a complicated story
everything we ve been able to learn is in this recording about twenty hours but you can probably fast most of it you know of course that dave bowman went out in the number 2 pod to rescue you but was then locked outside the ship because hal refused to open the pod bay doors why for god s sake dr kim winced slightly
it was not the first time poole had noticed such a reaction
must watch my language he thought
god seems to be a dirty word in this culture must ask indra about it
there was a major programming error in hal s instructions he d been given control of aspects of the mission you and bowman didn t know about it s all in the recording anyway he also cut off the life support systems to the three hybernauts the alpha crew and bowman had to jettison their bodies as well so dave and i were the beta crew something else i didn t know what happened to them poole asked
couldn t they have been rescued just as i was i m afraid not we ve looked into it of course
bowman ejected them several hours after he d taken back control from hal so their orbits were slightly different from yours
just enough for them to burn up in jupiter while you skimmed by and got a gravity boost that would have taken you to the orion nebula in a few thousand more years doing everything on manual override really a fantastic performance
bowman managed to get discovery into orbit round jupiter
and there he encountered what the second expedition called big brother an apparent twin of the tycho monolith but hundreds of times larger and that s where we lost him
he left discovery in the remaining space pod and made a rendezvous with big brother
for almost a thousand years we ve been haunted by his last message by deus it s full of stars here we go again
poole told himself
no way dave could have said that must have been my god it s full of stars apparently the pod was drawn into the monolith by some kind of inertial field because it and presumably bowman survived an acceleration which should have crushed them instantly
and that was the last information anyone had for almost ten years until the joint us russian leonov mission which made a rendezvous with the abandoned discovery so that dr chandra could go aboard and reactivate hal
yes i know that dr kim looked slightly embarrassed
sorry i wasn t sure how much you d been told already anyway that s when even stranger things started to happen apparently the arrival of leonov triggered something inside big brother
if we did not have these recordings no one would have believed what happened
let me show you here s dr heywood floyd keeping the midnight watch aboard discovery after power had been restored
of course you ll recognize everything indeed i do and how strange to see the long dead heywood floyd sitting in my old seat with hal s unblinking red eye surveying everything in sight
and even stranger to think that hal and i have both shared the same experience of resurrection from the dead a message was coining up on one of the monitors and floyd answered lazily ok hal
who is calling no identification
floyd looked slightly annoyed
very well
please give me the message it is dangerous to remain here
you must leave within fifteen days
that is absolutely impossible
our launch window does not open until twenty six days from now
we do not have sufficient propellant for an earlier departure i am aware of these facts
nevertheless you must leave within fifteen days
i cannot take this warning seriously unless i know its origin who is speaking to me i was david bowman
it is important that you believe me
look behind you
heywood floyd slowly turned in his swivel chair away from the banked panels and switches of the computer display towards the velcro covered catwalk behind
watch this carefully said dr kim
as if i needed telling thought poole the zero gravity environment of discovery s observation deck was much dustier than he remembered it he guessed that the air filtration plant had not yet been brought on line
the parallel rays of the distant yet still brilliant sun streaming through the great windows lit up a myriad of dancing motes in a classic display of brownian movement
and now something strange was happening to these particles of dust some force seemed to be marshalling them herding them away from a central point yet bringing others towards it until they all met on the surface of a hollow sphere
that sphere about a meter across hovered in the air for a moment like a giant soap bubble
then it elongated into an ellipsoid whose surface began to pucker to form folds and indentations
poole was not really surprised when it started to assume the shape of a man
he had seen such figures blown out of glass in museums and science exibitions
but this dusty phantom did not even approximate anatomical accuracy it was like a crude clay figurine or one of the primitive works of art found in the recesses of stone age caves
only the head was fashioned with care and the face beyond all shadow of doubt was that of commander david bowman
hello dr floyd
now do you believe me
the lips of the figure never moved poole realized that the voice yes certainly bowman s voice was actually coming from the speaker grille
this is very difficult for me and i have liitle time
i have been allowed to give this warning
you have only fiffeen days
why and what are you but the ghostly figure was already fading its grainy envelope beginning to dissolve back into the constituent particles of dust
goodbye doctor floyd
we can have no further contact
but there may be one more message if all goes well
as the image dissolved poole could not help smiling at that old space age clich
if all goes well how many times he had heard that phrase intoned before a mission
the phantom vanished only the motes of dancing dust were left resuming their random patterns in the air
with an effort of will poole came back to the present
well commander what do you think of that asked kim
poole was still shaken and it was several seconds before he could reply
the face and the voice were bowman s i d swear to that
but what was it that s what we re still arguing about
call it a hologram a projection of course there are plenty of ways it could be faked if anyone wanted to but not in those circumstances
and then of course there s what happened next lucifer yes
thanks to that warning the leonov had just sufficient time to get away before jupiter detonated so whatever it was the bowman thing was friendly and trying to help presumably
and it may have been responsible for that one more message we did receive it was sent only minutes before the detonation
another waning dr kim brought the screen to life once more
it showed plain text all these worlds are yours except europa
attempt no landings there
the same message was repeated about a hundred times then the letters became garbled
and we never have tried to land there asked poole
only once by accident thirty six years later when the usss galaxy was hijacked and forced down there and her sister ship universe had to go to the rescue
it s all here with what little our robot monitors have told us about the europans i m anxious to see them they re amphibious and come in all shapes and sizes
as soon as lucifer started melting the ice that covered theirt whole world they began to emerge from the sea
since then they ve developed at a speed that seems biologically impossible from what i remember about europa weren t there lots of cracks in the ice
perhaps they d already started crawling through and having a look round that s a widely accepted theory
but there s another much more speculative one
the monolith may have been involved in ways we don t yet understand
what triggered that line of thought was the discovery of tma zero right here on earth almost five hundred years after your time
i suppose you ve been told about that only vaguely there s been so much to catch up with
i did think the name was ridiculous since it wasn t a magnetic anomaly and it was in africa not tycho you re quite right of course but we re stuck with the name
and the more we learn about the monoliths the more the puzzle deepens
especially as they re still the only real evidence for advanced technology beyond the earth that s surprised me
i should have thought that by this lime we d have picked up radio signals from somewhere
the astronomers started searching when i was a boy well there is one hint and it s so terrifying that we don t like to talk about it
have you heard of nova scorpio i don t believe so stars go nova all the time of course and this wasn t a particularly impressive one
but before it blew up n scorp was known to have several planets inhabited absolutely no way of telling radio searches had picked up nothing
and here s the nightmare luckily the automatic nova patrol caught the event at the very beginning
and it didn t start at the star
one of the planets detonated first and then triggered its sun my gah sorry go on you see the point
it s impossible for a planet to go nova except in one way i once read a sick joke in a science fiction novel supernovae are industrial accidents it wasn t a supernova but that may be no joke
the most widely accepted theory is that someone else had been tapping vacuum energy and had lost control or it could have been a war just as bad we ll probably never know
but as our own civilization depends on the same energy source you can understand why n scorp sometimes gives us nightmares and we only had melting nuclear reactors to worry about not any longer thank deus
but i really wanted to tell you more about tma zero s discovery because it marked a turning point in human history finding tma one on the moon was a big enough shock but five hundred years later there was a worse one
and it was much nearer home in every sense of the word
down there in africa 8
return to olduvai the leakeys dr stephen del marco often told himself would never have recognized this place even though it s barely a dozen kilometers from where louis and mary five centuries ago dug up the bones of our first ancestors
global warming and the little ice age truncated by miracles of heroic technology had transformed the landscape and completely altered its biota
oaks and pine trees were still fighting it out to see which would survive the changes in climatic fortune
and it was hard to believe that by this year 2513 there was anything left in olduvai undug by enthusiastic anthropologists
however recent flash floods which were not supposed to happen any more had resculpted this area and cut away several meters of topsoil
del marco had taken advantage of the opportunity and there at the limit of the deep scan was something he could not quite believe
it had taken more than a year of slow and careful excavation to reach that ghostly image and to learn that the reality was stranger than anything he had dared to imagine
robot digging machines had swiftly removed the first few meters then the traditional slave crews of graduate students had taken over
they had been helped or hindered by a team of four kongs who del marco considered more trouble than they were worth
however the students adored the genetically enhanced gorillas whom they treated like retarded but much loved children
it was rumored that the relationships were not always completely platonic
for the last few meters however everything was the work of human hands usually wielding toothbrushes soft bristled at that
and now it was finished howard carter seeing the first glint of gold in tutankhamen s tomb had never uncovered such a treasure as this
from this moment onwards del marco knew human beliefs and philosophies would be irrevocably changed
the monolith appeared to be the exact twin of that discovered on the moon five centuries earlier even the excavation surrounding it was almost identical in size
and like tma one it was totally non reflective absorbing with equal indifference the fierce glare of the african sun and the pale gleam of lucifer
as he led his colleagues the directors of the world s half dozen most famous museums three eminent anthropologists the heads of two media empires down into the pit del marco wondered if such a distinguished group of men and women had ever been so silent for so long
but that was the effect that this ebon rectangle had on all visitors as they realized the implications of the thousands of artifacts that surrounded it
for here was an archaeologist s treasure trove crudely fashioned flint tools countless bones some animal some human and almost all arranged in careful patterns
for centuries no millennia these pitiful gifts had been brought here by creatures with only the first glimmer of intelligence as tribute to a marvel beyond their understanding
and beyond ours del marco had often thought
yet of two things he was certain though he doubted if proof would ever be possible
this was where in time and space the human species had really begun
and this monolith was the very first of all its multitudinous gods

skyland there were mice in my bedroom last night poole complained only half seriously
is there any chance you could find me a cat dr wallace looked puzzled then started to laugh
you must have heard one of the cleaning microts i ll get the programming checked so they don t disturb you
try not to step on one if you catch it at work if you do it will call for help and all its friends will come to pick up the pieces so much to learn so little time
no that wasn t true poole reminded himself
he might well have a century ahead of him thanks to the medical science of this age
the thought was already beginning to fill him with apprehension rather than pleasure
at least he was now able to follow most conversations easily and had learned to pronounce words so that indra was not the only person who could understand him
he was very glad that anglish was now the world language though french russian and mandarin still flourished
i ve another problem indra and i guess you re the only person who can help
when i say god why do people look embarrassed indra did not look at all embarrassed in fact she laughed
that s a very complicated story
i wish my old friend dr khan was here to explain it to you but he s on ganymede curing any remaining true believers he can find there
when all the old religions were discredited let me tell you about pope pius xx sometime one of the greatest men in history
we still needed a word for the prime cause or the creator of the universe if there is one there were lots of suggestions deo theo jove brahma they were all tried and some of them are still around especially einstein s favorite the old one
but deus seems to be the fashion nowadays i ll try to remember but it still seems silly to me you ll get used to it i ll teach you some other reasonably polite expletives to use when you want to express your feelings you said that all the old religions have been discredited
so what do people believe nowadays as little as possible
we re all either deists or theists you ve lost me
definitions please they were slightly different in your time but here are the latest versions
theists believe there s not more than one god deists that there is not less than one god i m afraid the distinction s too subtle for me not for everyone you d be amazed at the bitter controversies it s aroused
five centuries ago someone used what s known as surreal mathematics to prove there s an infinite number of grades between theists and deists
of course like most dabblers with infinity he went insane
by the way the best known deists were americans washington franklin jefferson a little before my time though you d be surprised how many people don t realize it now i ve some good news
joe prof anderson has finally given his what was the phrase
ok you re fit enough to go for a little trip upstairs to the lunar level wonderful
how far is that oh about twelve thousand kilometers twelve thousand
that will take hours indra looked surprised at his remark then she smiled
not as long as you think
no we don t have a star trek transporter yet though i believe they re still working on it
but you ll need new clothes and someone to show you how to wear them
and to help you with the hundreds of little everyday jobs that can waste so much time
so we ve taken the liberty of arranging a human personal assistant for you
come in danil danil was a small light brown man in his mid thirties who surprised poole by not giving him the usual palm top salute with its automatic exchange of information
indeed it soon appeared that danil did not possess an ident whenever it was needed he produced a small rectangle of plastic that apparently served the same purpose as the twenty first century s smart cards
danil will also be your guide and what was that word
i can never remember rhymes with ballet
he s been specially trained for the job
i m sure you ll find him completely satisfactory though poole appreciated this gesture it made him feel a little uncomfortable
a valet indeed
he could not recall ever meeting one in his time they were already a rare and endangered species
he began to feel like a character from an early twentieth century english novel
you have a choice said indra though i know which one you ll take
we can go up on an external elevator and admire the view or an interior one and enjoy a meal and some light entertainment i can t imagine anyone wanting to stay inside you d be surprised
it s too vertiginous for some people especially visitors from down below
even mountain climbers who say they ve got a head for heights may start to turn green when the heights are measured in thousands of kilometers instead of meters i ll risk it poole answered with a smile
i ve been higher when they had passed through a double set of airlocks in the exterior wall of the tower was it imagination or did he feel a curious sense of disorientation then
they entered what might have been the auditorium of a very small theatre
rows of ten seats were banked up in five tiers they all faced towards one of the huge picture windows which poole still found disconcerting as he could never quite forget the hundreds of tons of air pressure striving to blast it out into space
the dozen or so other passengers who had probably never given the matter any thought seemed perfectly at ease
they all smiled as they recognized him nodded politely then turned away to admire the view
welcome to skylounge said the inevitable autovoice
ascent begins in five minutes
you will find refreshments and toilets on the lower floor just how long will this trip last
poole wondered
we re going to travel over twenty thousand klicks there and back this will be like no elevator ride i ve ever known on earth
while he was waiting for the ascent to begin he enjoyed the stunning panorama laid out two thousand kilometers below
it was winter in the northern hemisphere but the climate had indeed changed drastically for there was little snow south of the arctic circle
europe was almost cloud free and there was so much detail that the eye was overwhelmed
one by one he identified the great cities whose names had echoed down the centuries they had been shrinking even in his time as the communications revolution changed the face of the world and had now dwindled still further
there were also some bodies of water in improbable places the northern sahara s lake saladin was almost a small sea
poole was so engrossed by the view that he had forgotten the passage of time
suddenly he realized that much more than five minutes had passed yet the elevator was still stationary
had something gone wrong or were they waiting for late arrivals
and then he noticed something so extraordinary that at first he refused to believe the evidence of his eyes
the panorama had expanded as if he had already risen hundreds of kilometers
even as he watched he noticed new features of the planet below creeping into the frame of the window
then poole laughed as the obvious explanation occurred to him
you could have fooled me indra
i thought this was real not a video projection indra looked back at him with a quizzical smile
think again frank
we started to move about ten minutes ago
by now we must be climbing at oh at least a thousand kilometers an hour
though i m told these elevators can reach a hundred gee at maximum acceleration we won t touch more than ten on this short run that s impossible
six is the maximum they ever gave me in the centrifuge and i didn t enjoy weighing half a ton
i know we haven t moved since we stepped inside poole had raised his voice slightly and suddenly became aware that the other passengers were pretending not to notice
i don t understand how it s done frank but it s called an inertial field
or sometimes a sharp one the s stands for a famous russian scientist sakharov i don t know who the others were slowly understanding dawned in poole s mind and also a sense of awe struck wonder
here indeed was a technology indistinguishable from magic
some of my friends used to dream of space drives energy fields that could replace rockets and allow movement without any feeling of acceleration most of us thought they were crazy but it seems they were right
i can still hardly believe it and unless i m mistaken we re starting to lose weight yes it s adjusting to the lunar value
when we step out you ll feel we re on the moon
but for goodness sake frank forget you re an engineer and simply enjoy the view it was good advice but even as he watched the whole of africa europe and much of asia flow into his field of vision poole could not tear his mind away from this astonishing revelation
yet he should not have been wholly surprised he knew that there had been major breakthroughs in space propulsion systems since his time but had not realized that they would have such dramatic applications to everyday life if that term could be applied to existence in a thirty six thousand kilometer high skyscraper
and the age of the rocket must have been over centuries ago
all his knowledge of propellant systems and combustion chambers ion thrusters and fusion reactors was totally obsolete
of course that no longer mattered but he understood the sadness that the skipper of a windjammer must have felt when sail gave way to steam
his mood changed abruptly and he could not help smiling when the robovoice announced arriving in two minutes
please make sure that you do not leave any of your personal belongings behind how often he had heard that announcement on some commercial flight
he looked at his watch and was surprised to see that they had been ascending for less than half an hour so that meant an average speed of at least twenty thousand kilometers an hour yet they might never have moved
what was even stranger for the last ten minutes or more they must actually have been decelerating so rapidly that by rights they should all have been standing on the roof heads pointing towards earth
the doors opened silently and as poole stepped out he again felt the slight disorientation he had noticed on entering the elevator lounge
this time however he knew what it meant he was moving through the transition zone where the inertial field overlapped with gravity at this level equal to the moon s
indra and danil followed him walking carefully now at a third of their customary weight as they went forward to meet the next of the day s wonders
though the view of the receding earth had been awesome even for an astronaut there was nothing unexpected or surprising about it
but who would have imagined a gigantic chamber apparently occupying the entire width of the tower so that the far wall was more than five kilometers away
perhaps by this time there were larger enclosed volumes on the moon and mars but this must surely be one of the largest in space itself
they were standing on a viewing platform fifty meters up on the outer wall looking across an astonishingly varied panorama
obviously an attempt had been made to reproduce a whole range of terrestrial biomes
immediately beneath them was a group of slender trees which poole could not at first identify then he realized that they were oaks adapted to one sixth of their normal gravity
what he wondered would palm frees look like here
giant reeds probably
in the middle distance there was a small lake fed by a river that meandered across a grassy plain then disappeared into something that looked like a single gigantic banyan tree
what was the source of the water
poole had become aware of a faint drumming sound and as he swept his gaze along the gently curving wall he discovered a miniature niagara with a perfect rainbow hovering in the spray above it
he could have stood here for hours admiring the view and still not exhausting all the wonders of this complex and brilliantly contrived simulation of the planet below
as it spread out into new and hostile environments perhaps the human race felt an ever increasing need to remember its origins
of course even in his own time every city had its parks as usually feeble reminders of nature
the same impulse must be acting here on a much grander scale
central park africa tower
let s go down said indra
there s so much to see and i don t come here as often as i d like followed by the silent but ever present danil who always seemed to know when he was needed but otherwise kept out of the way they began a leisurely exploration of this oasis in space
though walking was almost effortless in this low gravity from time to time they took advantage of a small monorail and stopped once for refreshments at a caf cunningly concealed in the trunk of a redwood that must have been at least a quarter of a kilometer tall
there were very few other people about their fellow passengers had long since disappeared into the landscape so it was as if they had all this wonderland to themselves
everything was so beautifully maintained presumably by armies of robots that from time to time poole was reminded of a visit he had made to disney world as a small boy
but this was even better there were no crowds and indeed very little reminder of the human race and its artifacts
they were admiring a superb collection of orchids some of enormous size when poole had one of the biggest shocks of his life
as they walked past a typical small gardener s shed the door opened and the gardener emerged
frank poole had always prided himself on his self control and never imagined that as a full grown adult he would give a cry of pure fright
but like every boy of his generation he had seen all the jurassic movies and he knew a raptor when he met one eye to eye
i m terribly sorry said indra with obvious concern
i never thought of warning you poole s jangling nerves returned to normal
of course there could be no danger in this perhaps too well ordered world but still
the dinosaur returned his stare with apparent total disinterest then doubled back into the shed and emerged again with a rake and a pair of garden shears which it dropped into a bag hanging over one shoulder
it walked away from them with a bird like gait never looking back as it disappeared behind some ten meter high sunflowers
i should explain said indra contritely
we like to use bio organisms when we can rather than robots i suppose it s carbon chauvinism
now there are only a few animals that have any manual dexterity and we ve used them all at one time or another and here s a mystery that no one s been able to solve
you d think that enhanced herbivores like orangutans and gorillas would be good at this sort of work
well they re not they don t have the patience for it yet carnivores like our friend here are excellent and easily trained
what s more here s another paradox
after they ve been modified they re docile and good natured
of course there s almost a thousand years of genetic engineering behind them and look what primitive man did to the wolf merely by trial and error indra laughed and continued you may not believe this frank but they also make good baby sitters children love them
there s a five hundred year old joke would you trust your kids to a dinosaur
what and risk injuring it
poole joined in the laughter partly in shame faced reaction to his own fright
to change the subject he asked indra the question that was still worrying him
all this he said it s wonderful but why go to so much trouble when anyone in the tower can reach the real thing just as quickly indra looked at him thoughtfully weighing her words
that s not quite true
it s uncomfortable even dangerous for anyone who lives above the half gee level to go down to earth even in a hoverchair
so it has to be this or as you used to say virtual reality now i begin to understand poole told himself bleakly
that explains anderson s evasiveness and all the tests he s been doing to see if i ve regained my strength
i ve come all the way back from jupiter to within two thousand kilometers of earth but i may never again walk on the surface of my home planet
i m not sure how i will be able to handle this 1
homage to icarus his depression quickly passed there was so much to do and see
a thousand lifetimes would not have been enough and the problem was to choose which of the myriad distractions this age could offer
he tried not always successfully to avoid the trivia and to concentrate on the things that mattered notably his education
the braincap and the book sized player that went with it inevitably called the brainbox was of enormous value here
he soon had a small library of instant knowledge tablets each containing all the material needed for a college degree
when he slipped one of these into the brainbox and gave it the speed and intensity adjustments that most suited him there would be a flash of light followed by a period of unconsciousness that might last as long as an hour
when he awoke it seemed that new areas of his mind had been opened up though he only knew they were there when he searched for them
it was almost as if he was the owner of a library who had suddenly discovered shelves of books he did not know he possessed
to a large extent he was the master of his own time
out of a sense of duty and gratitude he acceded to as many requests as he could from scientists historians writers and artists working in media that were often incomprehensible to him
he also had countless invitations from other citizens of the four towers virtually all of which he was compelled to turn down
most tempting and most hard to resist were those that came from the beautiful planet spread out below
of course professor anderson had told him you d survive if you went down for short time with the right life support system but you wouldn t enjoy it
and it might weaken your neuromuscular system even further
it s never really recovered from that thousand year sleep his other guardian indra wallace protected him from unnecessary intrusions and advised him which requests he should accept and which he should politely refuse
by himself he would never understand the socio political structure of this incredibly complex culture but he soon gathered that although in theory all class distinctions had vanished there were a few thousand super citizens
george orwell had been right some would always be more equal than others
there had been times when conditioned by his twenty first century experience poole had wondered who was paying for all this hospitality would he one day be presented with the equivalent of an enormous hotel bill
but indra had quickly reassured him he was a unique and priceless museum exhibit so would never have to worry about such mundane considerations
anything he wanted within reason would be made available to him poole wondered what the limits were never imagining that one day he would attempt to discover them
all the most important things in life happen by accident and he had set his wall display browser on random scan silent when a striking image caught his attention
stop scan
sound up he shouted with quite unnecessary loudness
he recognized the music but it was a few minutes before he identified it the fact that his wall was filled with winged humans circling gracefully round each other undoubtedly helped
but tchaikovsky would have been utterly astonished to see this performance of swan lake with the dancers actually flying poole watched entranced for several minutes until he was fairly confident that this was reality and not a simulation even in his own day one could never be quite certain
presumably the ballet was being performed in one of the many low gravity environments a very large one judging by some of the images
it might even be here in africa tower
i want to try that poole decided
he had never quite forgiven the space agency for banning one of his greatest pleasures delayed parachute formation jumping even though he could see the agency s point in not wanting to risk a valuable investment
the doctors had been quite unhappy about his earlier hang gliding accident fortunately his teenage bones had healed completely
well he thought there s no one to stop me now unless it s prof anderson to poole s relief the physician thought it an excellent idea and he was also pleased to find that every one of the towers had its own aviary up at the one tenth gee level
within a few days he was being measured for his wings not in the least like the elegant versions worn by the performers of swan lake
instead of feathers there was a flexible membrane and when he grasped the hand holds attached to the supporting ribs poole realized that he must look much more like a bat than a bird
however his move over dracula was completely wasted on his instructor who was apparently unacquainted with vampires
for his first lessons he was restrained by a light harness so that he did not move anywhere while he was taught the basic strokes and most important of all learned control and stability
like many acquired skills it was not quite as easy as it looked
he felt ridiculous in this safety harness how could anyone injure themselves at a tenth of a gravity
and was glad that he needed only a few lessons doubtless his astronaut training helped
he was the wingmaster told him the best pupil he had ever taught but perhaps he said that to all of them
after a dozen free flights in a chamber forty meters on a side criss crossed with various obstacles which he easily avoided poole was given the all clear for his first solo and felt nineteen years old again about to take off in the flagstaff aero club s antique cessna
the unexciting name the aviary had not prepared him for the venue of this maiden flight
though it seemed even more enormous than the space holding the forests and gardens down at the lunar gee level it was almost the same size since it too occupied an entire floor of the gently tapering tower
a circular void half a kilometer high and over four kilometers wide it appeared truly enormous as there were no features on which the eye could rest
because the walls were a uniform pale blue they contributed to the impression of infinite space
poole had not really believed the wingmaster s boast you can have any scenery you like and intended to throw him what he was sure was an impossible challenge
but on this first flight at the dizzy altitude of fifty meters there were no visual distractions of course a fall from the equivalent altitude of five meters in the ten fold greater earth gravity could break one s neck however even minor bruises were unlikely here as the entire floor was covered with a network of flexible cables the whole chamber was a giant trampoline one could thought poole have a lot of fun here even without wings
with firm downward strokes poole lifted himself into the air
in almost no time it seemed that he was a hundred meters in the air and still rising
slow down said the wingmaster i can t keep up with you poole straightened out then attempted a slow roll
he felt light headed as well as light bodied less than ten kilograms
and wondered if the concentration of oxygen had been increased
this was wonderful quite different from zero gravity as it posed more of a physical challenge
the nearest thing to it was scuba diving he wished there were birds here to emulate the equally colorful coral fish who had so often accompanied him over tropical reefs
one by one the wingmaster put him through a series of maneuvers rolls loops upside down flying hovering
finally he said nothing more i can teach you
now let s enjoy the view just for a moment poole almost lost control as he was probably expected to do
for without the slightest warning he was surrounded by snow capped mountains and was flying down a narrow pass only meters from some unpleasantly jagged rocks
of course this could not be real those mountains were as insubstantial as clouds and he could fly right through them if he wished
nevertheless he veered away from the cliff face there was an eagle s nest on one of its ledges holding two eggs which he felt he could touch if he came closer and headed for more open space
the mountains vanished suddenly it was night
and then the stars came out not the miserable few thousand in the impoverished skies of earth but legions beyond counting
and not only stars but the spiral whirlpools of distant galaxies the teeming close packed sun swarms of globular clusters
there was no possible way this could be real even if he had been magically transported to some world where such skies existed
for those galaxies were receding even as he watched stars were fading exploding being born in stellar nurseries of glowing fire mist
every second a million years must be passing
the overwhelming spectacle disappeared as quickly as it had come he was back in the empty sky alone except for his instructor in the featureless blue cylinder of the aviary
i think that s enough for one day said the wingmaster hovering a few meters above poole
what scenery would you like the next time you come here poole did not hesitate
with a smile he answered the question
11
here be dragons he would never have believed it possible even with the technology of this day and age
how many terabytes petabytes was there a large enough word
of information must have been accumulated over the centuries and in what sort of storage medium
better not think about it and follow indra s advice forget you re an engineer and enjoy yourself he was certainly enjoying himself now though his pleasure was mixed with an almost overwhelming sense of nostalgia
for he was flying or so it seemed at an altitude of about two kilometers above the spectacular and unforgotten landscape of his youth
of course the perspective was false since the aviary was only half a kilometer high but the illusion was perfect
he circled meteor crater remembering how he had scrambled up its sides during his earlier astronaut training
how incredible that anyone could ever have doubted its origin and the accuracy of its name
yet well into the twentieth century distinguished geologists had argued that it was volcanic not until the coming of the space age was it reluctantly accepted that all planets were still under continual bombardment
poole was quite sure that his comfortable cruising speed was nearer twenty than two hundred kilometers an hour yet he had been allowed to reach flagstaff in less than fifteen minutes
and there were the whitely gleaming domes of the lowell observatory which he had visited so often as a boy and whose friendly staff had undoubtedly been responsible for his choice of career
he had sometimes wondered what his profession might have been had he not been born in arizona near the very spot where the most long enduring and influential of martian fantasies had been created
perhaps it was imagination but poole thought he could just see lowell s unique tomb close to the great telescope which had fuelled his dreams
from what year and what season had this image been captured
he guessed it had come from the spy satellites which had watched over the world of the early twenty first century
it could not be much later than his own time for the layout of the city was just as he remembered
perhaps if he went low enough he would even see himself
but he knew that was absurd he had already discovered that this was the nearest he could get
if he flew any closer the image would start to breakup revealing its basic pixels
it was better to keep his distance and not destroy the beautiful illusion
and there it was incredible
was the little park where he had played with his junior and high school friends
the city fathers were always arguing about its maintenance as the water supply became more and more critical
well at least it had survived to this time whenever that might be
and then another memory brought tears to his eyes
along those narrow paths whenever he could get home from houston or the moon he had walked with his beloved rhodesian ridgeback throwing sticks for him to retrieve as man and dog had done from time immemorial
poole had hoped with all his heart that rikki would still be there to greet him when he returned from jupiter and had left him in the care of his younger brother martin
he almost lost control and sank several meters before regaining stability as he once more faced the bitter truth that both rikki and martin had been dust for centuries
when he could see properly again he noticed that the dark band of the grand canyon was just visible on the far horizon
he was debating whether to head for it he was growing a little tired when he became aware that he was not alone in the sky
something else was approaching and it was certainly not a human flyer
although it was difficult to judge distances here it seemed much too large for that
well he thought i m not particularly surprised to meet a pterodactyl here indeed it s just the sort of thing i d expect
i hope it s friendly or that i can outfly it if it isn t
oh no
a pterodactyl was not a bad guess maybe eight points out of ten
what was approaching him now with slow flaps of its great leathery wings was a dragon straight out of fairyland
and to complete the picture there was a beautiful lady riding on its back
at least poole assumed she was beautiful
the traditional image was rather spoiled by one trifling detail much of her face was concealed by a large pair of aviator s goggles that might have come straight from the open cockpit of a world war i biplane
poole hovered in mid air like a swimmer treading water until the oncoming monster came close enough for him to hear the flapping of its great wings
even when it was less than twenty meters away he could not decide whether it was a machine or a bio construct probably both
and then he forgot about the dragon for the rider removed her goggles
the trouble with clich s some philosopher remarked probably with a yawn is that they are so boringly true
but love at first sight is never boring
danil could provide no information but then poole had not expected any from him
his ubiquitous escort he certainly would not pass muster as a classic valet seemed so limited in his functions that poole sometimes wondered if he was mentally handicapped unlikely though that seemed
he understood the functioning of all the household appliances carried out simple orders with speed and efficiency and knew his way about the tower
but that was all it was impossible to have an intelligent conversation with him and any polite queries about his family were met with a look of blank incomprehension
poole had even wondered if he too was a bio robot
indra however gave him the answer he needed right away
oh you ve met the dragon lady is that what you call her
what s her real name and can you get me her ident
we were hardly in a position to touch palms of course no problemo where did you pick up that indra looked uncharacteristically confused
i ve no idea some old book or movie
is it a good figure of speech not if you re over fifteen i ll try to remember
now tell me what happened unless you want to make me jealous they were now such good friends that they could discuss any subject with perfect frankness
indeed they had laughingly lamented their total lack of romantic interest in each other though indra had once commented i guess that if we were both marooned on a desert asteroid with no hope of rescue we could come to some arrangement first you tell me who she is her name s aurora mcauley among many other things she s president of the society for creative anachronisms
and if you thought draco was impressive wait until you see some of their other ah creations
like moby dick and a whole zooful of dinosaurs mother nature never thought of this is too good to be true thought poole
i am the biggest anachronism on planet earth
12
frustration until now he had almost forgotten that conversation with the space agency psychologist
you may be gone from earth for at least three years
if you like i can give you a harmless anaphrodisiac implant that will last out the mission
i promise we ll more than make it up when you get home no thanks poole had answered trying to keep his face straight when he continued i think i can handle it nevertheless he had become suspicious after the third or fourth week and so had dave bowman
i ve noticed it too dave said i bet those damn doctors put something in our diet whatever that something was if indeed it had ever existed it was certainly long past its shelf life
until now poole had been too busy to get involved in any emotional entanglements and had politely turned down generous offers from several young and not so young ladies
he was not sure whether it was his physique or his fame that appealed to them perhaps it was nothing more than simple curiosity about a man who for all they knew might be an ancestor from twenty or thirty generations in the past
to poole s delight mistress mcauley s ident conveyed the information that she was currently between lovers and he wasted no further time in contacting her
within twenty four hours he was pillion riding with his arms enjoyably around her waist
he had also learned why aviator s goggles were a good idea for draco was entirely robotic and could easily cruise at a hundred klicks
poole doubted if any real dragons had ever attained such speeds
he was not surprised that the ever changing landscapes below them were straight out of legend
ali baba had waved angrily at them as they overtook his flying carpet shouting can t you see where you re going yet he must be a long way from baghdad because the dreaming spires over which they now circled could only be oxford
aurora confirmed his guess as she pointed down that s the pub the inn where lewis and tolkien used to meet their friends the inklings
and look at the river that boat just coming out from the bridge do you see the two little girls and the clergyman in it yes he shouted back against the gentle sussuration of draco s slipstream
and i suppose one of them is alice aurora turned and smiled at him over her shoulder she seemed genuinely delighted
quite correct she s an accurate replica based on the reverend s photos
i was afraid you wouldn t know
so many people stopped reading soon after your time poole felt a glow of satisfaction
i believe i ve passed another test he told himself smugly
riding on draco must have been the first
how many more i wonder
fighting with broadswords
but there were no more and the answer to the immemorial your place or mine was poole s
the next morning shaken and mortified he contacted professor anderson
everything was going splendidly he lamented when she suddenly became hysterical and pushed me away
i was afraid i d hurt her somehow then she called the roomlight we d been in darkness and jumped out of bed
i guess i was just staring like a fool he laughed ruefully
she was certainly worth staring at i m sure of it
go on after a few minutes she relaxed and said something i ll never be able to forget anderson waited patiently for poole to compose himself
she said i m really sorry frank
we could have had a good time
but i didn t know that you d been mutilated the professor looked baffled but only for a moment
oh i understand
i m sorry too frank perhaps i should have warned you
in my thirty years of practice i ve only seen half a dozen cases all for valid medical reasons which certainly didn t apply to you circumcision made a lot of sense in primitive times and even in your century as a defence against some unpleasant even fatal diseases in backward countries with poor hygiene
but otherwise there was absolutely no excuse for it and several arguments against as you ve just discovered i checked the records after i d examined you the first time and found that by mid twenty first century there had been so many malpractice suits that the american medical association had been forced to ban it
the arguments among the contemporary doctors are very entertaining i m sure they are said poole morosely
in some countries it continued for another century then some unknown genius coined a slogan please excuse the vulgarity god designed us circumcision is blasphemy
that more or less ended the practice
but if you want it would be easy to arrange a transplant you wouldn t be making medical history by any means i don t think it would work
afraid i d start laughing every time that s the spirit you re already getting over it somewhat to his surprise poole realized that anderson s prognosis was correct
he even found himself already laughing
now what frank aurora s society for creative anachronisms
i d hoped it would improve my chances
just my luck to have found one anachronism she doesn t appreciate 13
stranger in a strange time indra was not quite as sympathetic as he had hoped perhaps after all there was some sexual jealousy in their relationship
and much more serious what they wryly labelled the dragon debacle led to their first real argument
it began innocently enough when indra complained people are always asking me why i ve devoted my life to such a horrible period of history and it s not much of an answer to say that there were even worse ones then why are you interested in my century because it marks the transition between barbarism and civilization thank you
just call me conan conan
the only one i know is the man who invented sherlock holmes never mind sorry i interrupted
of course we in the so called developed countries thought we were civilized
at least war wasn t respectable any more and the united nations was always doing its best to stop the wars that did break out not very successfully i d give it about three out of ten
but what we find incredible is the way that people right up to the early 2 s
calmly accepted behavior we would consider atrocious
and believed in the most mind boggled boggling nonsense which surely any rational person would dismiss out of hand examples please well your really trivial loss started me doing some research and i was appalled by what i found
did you know that every year in some countries thousands of little girls were hideously mutilated to preserve their virginity
many of them died but the authorities turned a blind eye i agree that was terrible but what could my government do about it a great deal if it wished
but that would have offended the people who supplied it with oil and bought its weapons like the landmines that killed and maimed civilians by the thousand you don t understand indra
often we had no choice we couldn t reform the whole world
and didn t somebody once say politics is the art of the possible quite true which is why only second rate minds go into it
genius likes to challenge the impossible well i m glad you have a good supply of genius so you can put things right do i detect a hint of sarcasm
thanks to our computers we can run political experiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice
lenin was unlucky he was born a hundred years too soon
russian communism might have worked at least for a while if it had had microchips
and had managed to avoid stalin poole was constantly amazed by indra s knowledge of his age as well as by her ignorance of so much that he took for granted
in a way he had the reverse problem
even if he lived the hundred years that had been confidently promised him he could never learn enough to feel at home
in any conversation there would always be references he did not understand and jokes that would go over his head
worse still he would always feel on the verge of some faux pas about to create some social disaster that would embarrass even the best of his new friends
such as the occasion when he was lunching fortunately in his own quarters with indra and professor anderson
the meals that emerged from the autochef were always perfectly acceptable having been designed to match his physiological requirements
but they were certainly nothing to get excited about and would have been the despair of a twenty first century gourmet
then one day an unusually tasty dish appeared which brought back vivid memories of the deer hunts and barbecues of his youth
however there was something unfamiliar about both flavor and texture so poole asked the obvious question
anderson merely smiled but for a few seconds indra looked as if she was about to be sick
then she recovered and said you tell him after we ve finished eating now what have i done wrong
poole asked himself
half an hour later with indra rather pointedly absorbed in a video display at the other end of the room his knowledge of the third millennium made another major advance
corpse food was on the way out even in your time anderson explained
raising animals to ugh eat them became economically impossible
i don t know how many acres of land it took to feed one cow but at least ten humans could survive on the plants it produced
and probably a hundred with hydroponic techniques
but what finished the whole horrible business was not economics but disease
it started first with cattle then spread to other food animals a kind of virus i believe that affected the brain and caused a particularly nasty death
although a cure was eventually found it was too late to turn back the clock and anyway synthetic foods were now far cheaper and you could get them in any flavor you liked remembering weeks of satisfying but unexciting meals poole had strong reservations about this
for why he wondered did he still have wistful dreams of spare ribs and cordon bleu steaks
other dreams were far more disturbing and he was afraid that before long he would have to ask anderson for medical assistance
despite everything that was being done to make him feel at home the strangeness and sheer complexity of this new world were beginning to overwhelm him
during sleep as if in an unconscious effort to escape he often reverted to his earlier life but when he awoke that only made matters worse
he had travelled across to america tower and looked down in reality and not in simulation on the landscape of his youth and it had not been a good idea
with optical aid when the atmosphere was clear he d got so close that he could see individual human beings as they went about their affairs sometimes along streets that he remembered and always at the back of his mind was the knowledge that down there had once lived everyone he had ever loved mother father before he had gone off with that other woman dear uncle george and aunt lil brother martin and not least a succession of dogs beginning with the warm puppies of his earliest childhood and culminating in rikki
above all there was the memory and mystery of helena
it had begun as a casual affair in the early days of his astrotraining but had become more and more serious as the years went by
just before he had left for jupiter they had planned to make it permanent when he returned
and if he did not helena wished to have his child
he still recalled the blend of solemnity and hilarity with which they had made the necessary arrangements now a thousand years later despite all his efforts he had been unable to find if helena had kept her promise
just as there were now gaps in his own memory so there were also in the collective records of mankind
the worst was that created by the devastating electromagnetic pulse from the 23 4 asteroid impact which had wiped out several per cent of the world s information banks despite all backups and safety systems
poole could not help wondering if among all the exabytes that were irretrievably lost were the records of his own children even now his descendants of the thirtieth generation might be walking the earth but he would never know
it helped a little to have discovered that unlike aurora some ladies of this era did not consider him to be damaged goods
on the contrary they often found his alteration quite exciting but this slightly bizarre reaction made it impossible for poole to establish any close relationship
nor was he anxious to do so all that he really needed was the occasional healthy mindless exercise
mindless that was the trouble
he no longer had arty purpose in life
and the weight of too many memories was upon him echoing the title of a famous book he had read in his youth he often said to himself i am a stranger in a strange time there were even occasions when he looked down at the beautiful planet on which if he obeyed doctor s orders he could never walk again and wondered what it would be like to make a second acquaintance with the vacuum of space
though it was not easy to get through the airlocks without triggering some alarm it had been done every few years some determined suicide made a brief meteoric display in the earth s atmosphere
perhaps it was just as well that deliverance was on its way from a completely unexpected direction
nice to meet you commander poole for the second time i m sorry don t recall but then i see so many people no need to apologize
first time was out round neptune captain chandler delighted to see you
can i get something from the autochef anything with over twenty per cent alcohol will be fine and what are you doing back on earth
they told me you never come inside mars orbit almost true though i was born here i think it s a dirty smelly place too many people creeping up to a billion again more than ten billion in my time
by the way did you get my thank you message yes and i know i should have contacted you
but i waited until i headed sunwards again
so here i am
your good health as the captain disposed of his drink with impressive speed poole tried to analyze his visitor
beards even small goatees like chandler s were very rare in this society and he had never known an astronaut who wore one they did not co exist comfortably with space helmets
of course a captain might go for years between evs and in any case most outside jobs were done by robots but there was always the risk of the unexpected when one might have to get suited in a hurry
it was obvious that chandler was something of an eccentric and poole s heart warmed to him
you ve not answered my question
if you don t like earth what are you doing here oh mostly contacting old friends it s wonderful to forget hour long delays and to have real time conversations
but of course that s not the reason
my old rust bucket is having a refit up at the rim shipyard
and the armor has to be replaced when it gets down to a few centimeters thick i don t sleep too well armor dust shield
not such a problem in your time was it
but it s a dirty environment out round jupiter and our normal cruise speed is several thousand klicks a second
so there s a continuous gentle pattering like raindrops on the roof you re joking course i am
if we really could hear anything we d be dead
luckily this sort of unpleasantness is very rare last serious accident was twenty years ago
we know all the main comet streams where most of the junk is and are careful to avoid them except when we re matching velocity to round up ice
but why don t you come aboard and have a look around before we take off for jupiter i d be delighted did you say jupiter well ganymede of course anubis city
we ve a lot of business there and several of us have families we haven t seen for months poole scarcely heard him
suddenly unexpectedly and perhaps none too soon he had found a reason for living
commander frank poole was the sort of man who hated to leave a job undone and a few specks of cosmic dust even moving at a thousand kilometers a second were not likely to discourage him
he had unfinished business at the world once known as jupiter
ii
goliath 14
a farewell to earth anything you want within reason he had been told
frank poole was not sure if his hosts would consider that returning to jupiter was a reasonable request indeed he was not quite sure himself and was beginning to have second thoughts
he had already committed himself to scores of engagements weeks in advance
most of them he would be happy to miss but there were some he would be sorry to forgo
in particular he hated to disappoint the senior class from his old high school how astonishing that it still existed
when they planned to visit him next month
however he was relieved and a little surprised when both indra and professor anderson agreed that it was an excellent idea
for the first time he realized that they had been concerned with his mental health perhaps a holiday from earth would be the best possible cure
and most important of all captain chandler was delighted
you can have my cabin he promised
i ll kick the first mate out of hers there were times when poole wondered if chandler with his beard and swagger was not another anachronism
he could easily picture him on the bridge of a battered three master with skull and crossbones flying overhead
once his decision had been made events moved with surprising speed
he had accumulated very few possessions and fewer still that he needed to take with him
the most important was miss pringle his electronic alter ego and secretary now the storehouse of both his lives and the small stack of terabyte memories that went with her
miss pringle was not much larger than the hand held personal assistants of his own age and usually lived like the old west s colt 45 in a quick draw holster at his waist
she could communicate with him by audio or braincap and her prime duty was to act as an information filter and a buffer to the outside world
like any good secretary she knew when to reply in the appropriate format i ll put you through now or much more frequently i m sorry mr poole is engaged
please record your message and he will get back to you as soon as possible usually this was never
there were very few farewells to be made though realtime conversations would be impossible owing to the sluggish velocity of radio waves he would be in constant touch with indra and joseph the only genuine friends he had made
somewhat to his surprise poole realized that he would miss his enigmatic but useful valet because he would now have to handle all the small chores of everyday life by himself
danil bowed slightly when they parted but otherwise showed no sign of emotion as they took the long ride up to the outer curve of the world circling wheel thirty six thousand kilometers above central africa
i m not sure dim that you ll appreciate the comparison
but do you know what goliath reminds me of they were now such good friends that poole could use the captain s nickname but only when no one else was around
something unflattering i assume not really
but when i was a boy i came across a whole pile of old science fiction magazines that my uncle george had abandoned pulps they were called after the cheap paper they were printed on most of them were already falling to bits
they had wonderful garish covers showing strange planets and monsters and of course spaceships
as i grew older i realized how ridiculous those spaceships were
they were usually rocket driven but there was never any sign of propellant tanks
some of them had rows of windows from stem to stem just like ocean liners
there was one favorite of mine with a huge glass dome a space going conservatory well those old artists had the last laugh too bad they could never know
goliath looks more like their dreams than the flying fuel tanks we used to launch from the cape
your inertial drive still seems too good to be true no visible means of support unlimited range and speed sometimes i think i m the one who s dreaming chandler laughed and pointed to the view outside
does that look like a dream it was the first time that poole had seen a genuine horizon since he had come to star city and it was not quite as far away as he had expected
after all he was on the outer rim of a wheel seven times the diameter of earth so surely the view across the roof of this artificial world should extend for several hundred kilometers
he used to be good at mental arithmetic a rare achievement even in his time and probably much rarer now
the formula to give the horizon distance was a simple one the square root of twice your height times the radius the sort of thing you never forgot even if you wanted to let s see we re about 8 meters up so root 16 this is easy
say big r is 4 knock off those three zeros to make it all klicks 4 times root 4 hmm just over 25 well twenty five kilometers was a fair distance and certainly no spaceport on earth had ever seemed this huge
even knowing perfectly well what to expect it was uncanny to watch vessels many times the size of his long lost discovery lifting off not only with no sound but with no apparent means of propulsion
though poole missed the flame and fury of the old time countdowns he had to admit that this was cleaner more efficient and far safer
strangest of all though was to sit up here on the rim in the geostationary orbit itself and to feel weight
just meters away outside the window of the tiny observation lounge servicing robots and a few spacesuited humans were gliding gently about their business yet here inside goliath the inertial field was maintaining standard mars gee
sure you don t want to change your mind frank captain chandler had asked jokingly as he left for the bridge
still ten minutes before lift off wouldn t be very popular if i did would i
no as they used to say back in the old days we have commit
ready or not here i come poole felt the need to be alone when the drive went on and the tiny crew only four men and three women respected his wish
perhaps they guessed how he must be feeling to leave earth for the second time in a thousand years and once again to face an unknown destiny
jupiter lucifer was on the other side of the sun and the almost straight line of goliath s orbit would take them close to venus
poole looked forward to seeing with his own unaided eyes if earth s sister planet was now beginning to live up to that description after centuries of terraforming
from a thousand kilometers up star city looked like a gigantic metal band around earth s equator dotted with gantries pressure domes scaffolding holding half completed ships antennas and other more enigmatic structures
it was diminishing swiftly as goliath headed sunwards and presently poole could see how incomplete it was there were huge gaps spanned only by a spider s web of scaffolding which would probably never be completely enclosed
and now they were falling below the plane of the ring it was midwinter in the northern hemisphere so the slim halo of star city was inclined at over twenty degrees to the sun
already poole could see the american and asian towers as shining threads stretching outwards and away beyond the blue haze of the atmosphere
he was barely conscious of time as goliath gained speed moving more swiftly than any comet that had ever fallen sunwards from interstellar space
the earth almost full still spanned his field of view and he could now see the full length of the africa tower which had been his home in the life he was now leaving perhaps he could not help thinking leaving for ever
when they were fifty thousand kilometers out he was able to view the whole of star city as a narrow ellipse enclosing the earth
though the far side was barely visible as a hair line of light against the stars it was awe inspiring to think that the human race had now set this sign upon the heavens
then poole remembered the rings of saturn infinitely more glorious
the astronautical engineers still had a long long way to go before they could match the achievements of nature
or if that was the right word deus
15
transit of venus when he woke the next morning they were already at venus
but the huge dazzling crescent of the still cloud wrapped planet was not the most striking object in the sky goliath was floating above an endless expanse of crinkled silver foil flashing in the sunlight with ever changing patterns as the ship drifted across it
poole remembered that in his own age there had been an artist who had wrapped whole buildings in plastic sheets how he would have loved this opportunity to package billions of tons of ice in a glittering envelope only in this way could the core of a comet be protected from evaporation on its decades long journey sunwards
you re in luck frank chandler had told him
this is something i ve never seen myself
it should be spectacular
impact due in just over an hour
we ve given it a little nudge to make sure it comes down in the right place
don t want anyone to get hurt poole looked at him in astonishment
you mean there are already people on venus about fifty mad scientists near the south pole
of course they re well dug in but we should shake them up a bit even though ground zero is on the other side of the planet
or i should say atmosphere zero it will be days before anything except the shockwave gets down to the surface as the cosmic iceberg sparkling and flashing in its protective envelope dwindled away towards venus poole was struck with a sudden poignant memory
the christmas trees of his childhood had been adorned with just such ornaments delicate bubbles of colored glass
and the comparison was not completely ludicrous for many families on earth this was still the right season for gifts and goliath was bringing a present beyond price to another world
the radar image of the tortured venusian landscape its weird volcanoes pancake domes and narrow sinuous canyons dominated the main screen of goliath s control center but poole preferred the evidence of his own eyes
although the unbroken sea of clouds that covered the planet revealed nothing of the inferno beneath he wanted to see what would happen when the stolen comet struck
in a matter of seconds the myriad of tons of frozen hydrates that had been gathering speed for decades on the downhill run from neptune would deliver all their energy
the initial flash was even brighter than he had expected
how strange that a missile made of ice could generate temperatures that must be in the tens of thousands of degrees
though the filters of the view port would have absorbed all the dangerous shorter wave lengths the fierce blue of the fireball proclaimed that it was hotter than the sun
it was cooling rapidly as it expanded through yellow orange red
the shockwave would now be spreading outwards at the velocity of sound and what a sound that must be
so in a few minutes there should be some visible indication of its passage across the face of venus
and there it was
only a tiny black ring like an insignificant puff of smoke giving no hint of the cyclonic fury that must be blasting its way outwards from the point of impact
as poole watched it slowly expanded though owing to its scale there was no sense of visible movement he had to wait for a full minute before he could be quite sure that it had grown larger
after a quarter of an hour however it was the most prominent marking on the planet
though much fainter a dirty grey rather than black the shockwave was now a ragged circle more than a thousand kilometers across
poole guessed that it had lost its original symmetry while sweeping over the great mountain ranges that lay beneath it
captain chandler s voice sounded briskly over the ship s address system
putting you through to aphrodite base
glad to say they re not shouting for help shook us up a bit but just what we expected
monitors indicate some rain already over the nokomis mountains it will soon evaporate but that s a beginning
and there seems to have been a flash flood in hecate chasm too good to be true but we re checking
there was a temporary lake of boiling water there after the last delivery i don t envy them poole told himself but i certainly admire them
they prove that the spirit of adventure still exists in this perhaps too comfortable and too well adjusted society
and thanks again for bringing this little load down in the right place
with any luck and if we can get that sun screen up into sync orbit we ll have some permanent seas before long
and then we can plant coral reefs to make lime and pull the excess co2 out of the atmosphere hope i live to see it i hope you do thought poole in silent admiration
he had often dived in the tropical seas of earth admiring weird and colorful creatures so bizarre that it was hard to believe anything stranger would be found even on the planets of other suns
package delivered on time and receipt acknowledged said captain chandler with obvious satisfaction
goodbye venus ganymede here we come miss pringle file wallace hello indra
yes you were quite right
i do miss our little arguments
chandler and i get along fine and at first the crew treated me this will amuse you rather like a holy relic
but they re beginning to accept me and have even started to pull my leg do you know that idiom
it s annoying not to be able to have a real conversation we ve crossed the orbit of mars so radio round trip is already over an hour
but there s one advantage you won t be able to interrupt me
even though it will take us only a week to reach jupiter i thought i d have time to relax
not a bit of it my fingers started to itch and i couldn t resist going back to school
so i ve begun basic training all over again in one of goliath s minishuttles
maybe dim will actually let me solo
it s not much bigger than discovery s pods but what a difference
first of all of course it doesn t use rockets i can t get used to the luxury of the inertial drive and unlimited range
could fly back to earth if i had to though i d probably get remember the phrase i used once and you guessed its meaning
stir crazy
the biggest difference though is the control system
it s been a big challenge for me to get used to hands off operation and the computer has had to learn to recognize my voice commands
at first it was asking every five minutes do you really mean that i know it would be better to use the braincap but i m still not completely confident with that gadget
not sure if i ll ever get used to something reading my mind
by the way the shuttle s called falcon
it s a nice name and i was disappointed to find that no one aboard knew that it goes all the way back to the apollo missions when we first landed on the moon uh huh there was a lot more i wanted to say but the skipper is calling
back to the classroom love and out
store transmit hello frank indra calling if that s right word
on my new thoughtwriter old one had nervous breakdown ha ha so be lots of mistakes no time to edit before i send
hope you can make sense
comset
channel one oh three record from twelve thirty correction thirteen thirty
sorry hope i can get old unit fixed knew all my short cuts and abbrieves maybe should get psychoanalyzed like in your time never understood how that fraudian mean freudian ha ha nonsense lasted as long as it did reminds me came across late twentieth defin other day may amuse you something like this quote psychoanalysis contagious disease originating vienna circa 19 now extinct in europe but occasional outbreaks among rich americans
unquote
funny
sorry again trouble with thoughtwriters hard to stick to point xz 12 w 888 5 js98l2yebdc damn stop backup did i do something wrong then
will try again
you mentioned danil sorry we always evaded your questions about him knew you were curious but we had very good reason remember you once called him a non person
not bad guess
once you asked me about crime nowadays i said any such interest pathological maybe prompted by the endless sickening television programs of your time never able to watch more than few minutes myself disgusting
door acknowledge
oh hello melinda excuse sit down nearly finished
yes crime
always some society s irreducible noise level
what to do
your solution prisons
state sponsored perversion factories costing ten times average family income to hold one inmate
utterly crazy obviously something very wrong with people who shouted loudest for more prisons they should be psychoanalyzed
but let s be fair really no alternative before electronic monitoring and control perfected you should see the joyful crowds smashing the prison walls then nothing like it since berlin fifty years earlier
yes danil
i don t know what his crime was wouldn t tell you if i did but presume his psych profile suggested he d make a good what was the word
ballet no valet
very hard to get people for some jobs don t know how we d manage if crime level zero
anyway hope he s soon decontrolled and back in normal society sorry melinda nearly finished that s it frank regards to dimitri you must be halfway to ganymede now wonder if they ll ever repeal einstein so we can talk across space in real time
hope this machine soon gets used to me
otherwise be looking round for genuine antique twentieth century word processor would you believe once even mastered that qwertyiyuiop nonsense which you took a couple of hundred years to get rid of
love and goodbye
hello frank here i am again
still waiting acknowledgement of my last
strange you should be heading towards ganymede and my old friend ted khan
but perhaps it s not such a coincidence he was drawn by the same enigma that you were first i must tell you something about him
his parents played a dirty trick giving him the name theodore
that shortens don t ever call him that
to theo
see what i mean
can t help wondering if that s what drives him
don t know anyone else who s developed such an interest in religion no obsession
better warn you he can be quite a bore
by the way how am i doing
i miss my old thinkwriter but seem to be getting this machine under control
haven t made any bad what did you call them
bloopers glitches fluffs so far at least not sure i should tell you this in case you accidentally blurt it out but my private nickname for ted is the last jesuit
you must know something about them the order was still very active in your time
amazing people often great scientists superb scholars did a tremendous amount of good as well as much harm
one of history s supreme ironies sincere and brilliant seekers of knowledge and truth yet their whole philosophy hopelessly distorted by superstition xuedn2k3jn deer 2leidj dwpp damn
got emotional and lost control
one two three four now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party that s better
anyway ted has that same brand of high minded determination don t get into any arguments with him he ll go over you like a steam roller
by the way what were steam rollers
used for pressing clothes
can see how that could be very uncomfortable trouble with thinkwriters too easy to go off in all directions no matter how hard you try to discipline yourself something to be said for keyboards after all sure i ve said that before ted khan ted khan ted khan he s still famous back on earth for at least two of his sayings civilization and religion are incompatible and faith is believing what you know isn t true
actually i don t think the last one is original if it is that s the nearest he ever got to a joke
he never cracked a smile when i tried one of my favorites on him hope you haven t heard it before
it obviously dates from your time
the dean s complaining to his faculty
why do you scientists need such expensive equipment
why can t you be like the maths department which only needs a blackboard and a waste paper basket
better still like the department of philosophy
that doesn t even need a wastepaper basket well perhaps ted had heard it before
i expect most philosophers have
anyway give him my regards and don t repeat don t get into any arguments with him
love and best wishes from africa tower

transmit poole 16
the captain s table the arrival of such a distinguished passenger had caused a certain disruption in the tight little world of goliath but the crew had adapted to it with good humor
every day at 18 hours all personnel gathered for dinner in the wardroom which in zero gee could hold at least thirty people in comfort if spread uniformly around the walls
however most of the time the ship s working areas were held at lunar gravity so there was an undeniable floor and more than eight bodies made a crowd
the semi circular table that unfolded around the auto chef at mealtimes could just seat the entire seven person crew with the captain at the place of honor
one extra created such insuperable problems that somebody now had to eat alone for every meal
after much good natured debate it was decided to make the choice in alphabetical order not of proper names which were hardly ever used but of nicknames
it had taken poole some time to get used to them bolts structural engineering chips computers and communications first first mate life medical and life support systems props propulsion and power and stars orbits and navigation
during the ten day voyage as he listened to the stories jokes and complaints of his temporary shipmates poole learned more about the solar system than during his months on earth
all aboard were obviously delighted to have a new and perhaps na ve listener as an attentive one man audience but poole was seldom taken in by their more imaginative stories
yet sometimes it was hard to know where to draw the line
no one really believed in the golden asteroid which was usually regarded as a twenty fourth century hoax
but what about the mercurian plasmoids which had been reported by at least a dozen reliable witnesses during the last five hundred years
the simplest explanation was that they were related to ball lightning responsible for so many unidentified flying object reports on earth and mars
but some observers swore that they had shown purposefulness even inquisitiveness when they were encountered at close quarters
nonsense answered the sceptics merely electrostatic attraction
inevitably this led to discussions about life in the universe and poole found himself not for the first time defending his own era against its extremes of credulity and scepticism
although the aliens are among us mania had already subsided when he was a boy even as late as the 2 2 s the space agency was still plagued by lunatics who claimed to have been contacted or abducted by visitors from other worlds
their delusions had been reinforced by sensational media exploitation and the whole syndrome was later enshrined in the medical literature as adamski s disease
the discovery of tma one had paradoxically put an end to this sorry nonsense by demonstrating that though there was indeed intelligence elsewhere it had apparently not concerned itself with mankind for several million years
tma one had also convincingly refuted the handful of scientists who argued that life above the bacterial level was such an improbable phenomenon that the human race was alone in this galaxy if not the cosmos
goliath s crew was more interested in the technology than the politics and economics of poole s era and were particularly fascinated by the revolution that had taken place in his own lifetime the end of the fossil fuel age triggered by the harnessing of vacuum energy
they found it hard to imagine the smog choked cities of the twentieth century and the waste greed and appalling environmental disasters of the oil age
don t blame me said poole fighting back gamely after one round of criticism
anyway see what a mess the twenty first century made there was a chorus of what do you mean s around the table
well as soon as the so called age of infinite power got under way and everyone had thousands of kilowatts of cheap clean energy to play with you know what happened oh you mean the thermal crisis
but that was fixed eventually after you d covered half the earth with reflectors to bounce the sun s heat back into space
otherwise it would have been as parboiled as venus by now the crew s knowledge of third millennium history was so surprisingly limited that poole thanks to the intensive education he had received in star city could often amaze them with details of events centuries after his own time
however he was flattered to discover how well acquainted they were with discovery s log it had become one of the classic records of the space age
they looked on it as he might have regarded a viking saga often he had to remind himself that he was midway in time between goliath and the first ships to cross the western ocean on your day 86 stars reminded him at dinner on the fifth evening you passed within two thousand kay of asteroid 7794 and shot a probe into it
do you remember of course i do poole answered rather brusquely to me it happened less than a year ago um sorry
well tomorrow we ll be even closer to 13 445
like to have a look
with autoguidance and freeze frame we should have a window all of ten milliseconds wide a hundredth of a second
that few minutes in discovery had seemed hectic enough but now everything would happen fifty times faster
how large is it poole asked
thirty by twenty by fifteen meters stars replied
looks like a battered brick sorry we don t have a slug to fire at it said props
did you ever wonder if 7794 would hit back never occurred to us
but it did give the astronomers a lot of useful information so it was worth the risk
anyway a hundredth of a second hardly seems worth the bother
thanks all the same i understand
when you ve seen one asteroid you ve seen them not true chips
when i was on eros as you ve told us at least a dozen times poole s mind tuned out the discussion so that it was a background of meaningless noise
he was a thousand years in the past recalling the only excitement of discovery s mission before the final disaster
though he and bowman were perfectly aware that 7794 was merely a lifeless airless chunk of rock that knowledge scarcely affected their feelings
it was the only solid matter they would meet this side of jupiter and they had stared at it with the emotions of sailors on a long sea voyage skirting a coast on which they could not land
it was turning slowly end over end and there were mottled patches of light and shade distributed at random over its surface
sometimes it sparkled like a distant window as planes or outcroppings of crystalline material flashed in the sun
he remembered also the mounting tension as they waited to see if their aim had been accurate
it was not easy to hit such a small target two thousand kilometers away moving at a relative velocity of twenty kilometers a second
then against the darkened portion of the asteroid there had been a sudden dazzling explosion of light
the tiny slug pure uranium 238 had impacted at meteoric speed in a fraction of a second all its kinetic energy had been transformed into heat
a puff of incandescent gas had erupted briefly into space and discovery s cameras were recording the rapidly fading spectral lines looking for the tell tale signatures of glowing atoms
a few hours later back on earth the astronomers learned for the first time the composition of an asteroid s crust
there were no major surprises but several bottles of champagne changed hands
captain chandler himself took little part in the very democratic discussions around his semi circular table he seemed content to let his crew relax and express their feelings in this informal atmosphere
there was only one unspoken rule no serious business at mealtimes
if there were any technical or operational problems they had to be dealt with elsewhere
poole had been surprised and a little shocked to discover that the crew s knowledge of goliath s systems was very superficial
often he had asked questions which should have been easily answered only to be referred to the ship s own memory banks
after a while however he realized that the sort of in depth training he had received in his days was no longer possible far too many complex systems were involved for any man or woman s mind to master
the various specialists merely had to know what their equipment did not how
reliability depended on redundancy and automatic checking and human intervention was much more likely to do harm than good
fortunately none was required on this voyage it had been as uneventful as any skipper could have hoped when the new sun of lucifer dominated the sky ahead
iii
the worlds of galileo extract text only tourist s guide to outer solar system v 219 3 even today the giant satellites of what was once jupiter present us with major mysteries
why are four worlds orbiting the same primary and very similar in size so different in most other respects
only in the case of io the innermost satellite is there a convincing explanation
it is so close to jupiter that the gravitational tides constantly kneading its interior generate colossal quantities of heat so much indeed that io s surface is semi molten
it is the most volcanically active world in the solar system maps of io have a half life of only a few decades
though no permanent human bases have ever been established in such an unstable environment there have been numerous landings and there is continuous robot monitoring
for the tragic fate of the 2571 expedition see beagle 5
europa second in distance from jupiter was originally entirely covered in ice and showed few surface features except a complicated network of cracks
the tidal forces which dominate io were much less powerful here but produced enough heat to give europa a global ocean of liquid water in which many strange life forms have evolved
in 2 1 the chinese ship tsien touched down on europa on one of the few outcrops of solid rock protruding through the crust of ice
in doing so it disturbed a creature of the europan abyss and was destroyed see spacecraft tsien galaxy universe
since the conversion of jupiter into the mini sun lucifer in 2 61 virtually all of europa s ice cover has melted and extensive vulcanism has created several small islands
as is well known there have been no landings on europa for almost a thousand years but the satellite is under continuous surveillance
ganymede largest moon in the solar system diameter 526 kilometers has also been affected by the creation of a new sun and its equatorial regions are warm enough to sustain terrestrial life forms though it does not yet have a breathable atmosphere
most of its population is actively engaged in terraforming and scientific research the main settlement is anubis pop 41 near the south pole
callisto is again wholly different
its entire surface is covered by impact craters of all sizes so numerous that they overlap
the bombardment must have continued for millions of years for the newer craters have completely obliterated the earlier ones
there is no permanent base on callisto but several automatic stations have been established there
17
ganymede it was unusual for frank poole to oversleep but he had been kept awake by strange dreams
past and present were inextricably mixed sometimes he was on discovery sometimes in the africa tower and sometimes he was a boy again among friends he had thought long forgotten
where am i
he asked himself as he struggled up to consciousness like a swimmer trying to get back to the surface
there was a small window just above his bed covered by a curtain not thick enough to completely block the light from outside
there had been a time around the mid twentieth century when aircraft had been slow enough to feature first class sleeping accommodation poole had never sampled this nostalgic luxury which some tourist organizations had still advertised in his own day but he could easily imagine that he was doing so now
he drew the curtain and looked out
no he had not awakened in the skies of earth though the landscape unrolling below was not unlike the antarctic
but the south pole had never boasted two suns both rising at once as goliath swept towards them
the ship was orbiting less than a hundred kilometers above what appeared to be an immense ploughed field lightly dusted with snow
but the ploughman must have been drunk or the guidance system must have gone crazy for the furrows meandered in every direction sometimes cutting across each other or turning back on themselves
here and there the terrain was dotted with faint circles ghost craters from meteor impacts aeons ago
so this is ganymede poole wondered drowsily
mankind s furthest outpost from home
why should any sensible person want to live here
well i ve often thought that when i ve flown over greenland or iceland in winter time
there was a knock on the door a mind if i come in and captain chandler did so without waiting for a reply
thought we d let you sleep until we landed that end of trip party did last longer than i d intended but i couldn t risk a mutiny by cutting it short poole laughed
has there ever been a mutiny in space oh quite a few but not in my time
now we ve mentioned the subject you might say that hal started the tradition sorry perhaps i shouldn t look there s ganymede city coming up over the horizon was what appeared to be a criss cross pattern of streets and avenues intersecting almost at right angles but with the slight irregularity typical of any settlement that had grown by accretion without central planning
it was bisected by a broad river poole recalled that the equatorial regions of ganymede were now warm enough for liquid water to exist and it reminded him of an old wood cut he had seen of medieval london
then he noticed that chandler was looking at him with an expression of amusement and the illusion vanished as he realized the scale of the city
the ganymedeans he said dryly must have been rather large to have made roads five or ten kilometers wide twenty in some places
impressive isn t it
and all the result of ice stretching and contracting
mother nature is ingenious
i could show you some patterns that look even more artificial though they re not as large as this one when i was a boy there was a big fuss about a face on mars
of course it turned out to be a hill that had been carved by sand storms lots of similar ones in earth s deserts didn t someone say that history always repeats itself
same sort of nonsense happened with ganymede city some nuts claimed it had been built by aliens
but i m afraid it won t be around much longer why asked poole in surprise
it s already started to collapse as lucifer melts the permafrost
you won t recognize ganymede in another hundred years there s the edge of lake gilgamesh if you look carefully over on the right i see what you mean
what s happening surely the water s not boiling even at this low pressure electrolysis plant
don t know how many skillions of kilograms of oxygen a day
of course the hydrogen goes up and gets lost we hope chandler s voice trailed off into silence
then he resumed in an unusually diffident tone all that beautiful water down there ganymede doesn t need half of it
don t tell anyone but i ve been working out ways of getting some to venus easier than nudging comets as far as energy is concerned yes ganymede s escape velocity is only three klicks per second
and much much quicker years instead of decades
but there are a few practical difficulties i can appreciate that
would you shoot it off by a mass launcher oh no i d use towers reaching up through the atmosphere like the ones on earth but much smaller
we d pump the water up to the top freeze it down to near absolute zero and let ganymede sling it off in the right direction as it rotated
there would be some evaporation loss in transit but most of it would arrive what s so funny sorry i m not laughing at the idea it makes good sense
but you ve brought back such a vivid memory
we used to have a garden sprinkler driven round and round by its water jets
what you re planning is the same thing on a slightly bigger scale using a whole world suddenly another image from his past obliterated all else
poole remembered how in those hot arizona days he and rikki had loved to chase each other through the clouds of moving mist from the slowly revolving spray of the garden sprinkler
captain chandler was a much more sensitive man than he pretended to be he knew when it was time to leave
gotta get back to the bridge he said gruffly
see you when we land at anubis 18
grand hotel the grand ganymede hotel inevitably known throughout the solar system as hotel grannymede was certainly not grand and would be lucky to get a rating of one and a half stars on earth
as the nearest competition was several hundred million kilometers away the management felt little need to exert itself unduly
yet poole had no complaints though he often wished that danil was still around to help him with the mechanics of life and to communicate more efficiently with the semi intelligent devices with which he was surrounded
he had known a brief moment of panic when the door had closed behind the human bellboy who had apparently been too awed by his guest to explain how any of the room s services functioned
after five minutes of fruitless talking to the unresponsive walls poole had finally made contact with a system that understood his accent and his commands
what an all worlds news item it would have made historic astronaut starves to death trapped in ganymede hotel room
and there would have been a double irony
perhaps the naming of the grannymede s only luxury suite was inevitable but it had been a real shock to meet an ancient life size holo of his old shipmate in full dress uniform as he was led into the bowman suite
poole even recognized the image his own official portrait had been made at the same time a few days before the mission began
he soon discovered that most of his goliath crewmates had domestic arrangements in anubis and were anxious for him to meet their significant others during the ship s planned twenty day stop
almost immediately he was caught up in the social and professional life of this frontier settlement and it was africa tower that now seemed a distant dream
like many americans in their secret hearts poole had a nostalgic affection for small communities where everyone knew everyone else in the real world and not the virtual one of cyberspace
anubis with a resident population less than that of his remembered flagstaff was not a bad approximation to this ideal
the three main pressure domes each two kilometers in diameter stood on a plateau overlooking an ice field which stretched unbroken to the horizon
ganymede s second sun once known as jupiter would never give sufficient heat to melt the polar caps
this was the principal reason for establishing anubis in such an inhospitable spot the city s foundations were not likely to collapse for at least several centuries
and inside the domes it was easy to be completely indifferent to the outside world
poole when he had mastered the mechanisms of the bowman suite discovered that he had a limited but impressive choice of environments
he could sit beneath palm trees on a pacific beach listening to the gentle murmur of the waves or if he preferred the roar of a tropical hurricane
he could fly slowly along the peaks of the himalayas or down the immense canyons of mariner valley
he could walk through the gardens of versailles or down the streets of half a dozen great cities at several widely spaced times in their history
even if the hotel grannymede was not one of the solar system s most highly acclaimed resorts it boasted facilities which would have astounded all its more famous predecessors on earth
but it was ridiculous to indulge in terrestrial nostalgia when he had come half way across the solar system to visit a strange new world
after some experimenting poole arranged a compromise for enjoyment and inspiration during his steadily fewer moments of leisure
to his great regret he had never been to egypt so it was delightful to relax beneath the gaze of the sphinx as it was before its controversial restoration and to watch tourists scrambling up the massive blocks of the great pyramid
the illusion was perfect apart from the no man s land where the desert clashed with the slightly worn carpet of the bowman suite
the sky however was one that no human eyes had seen until five thousand years after the last stone was laid at giza
but it was not an illusion it was the complex and ever changing reality of ganymede
because this world like its companions had been robbed of its spin aeons ago by the tidal drag of jupiter the new sun born from the giant planet hung motionless in its sky
one side of ganymede was in perpetual lucifer light and although the other hemisphere was often referred to as the night land that designation was as misleading as the much earlier phrase the dark side of the moon
like the lunar farside ganymede s night land had the brilliant light of old sol for half of its long day
by a coincidence more confusing than useful ganymede took almost exactly one week seven days three hours to orbit its primary
attempts to create a one mede day one earth week calendar had generated so much chaos that they had been abandoned centuries ago
like all the other residents of the solar system the locals employed universal time identifying their twenty four hour standard days by numbers rather than names
since ganymede s newborn atmosphere was still extremely thin and almost cloudless the parade of heavenly bodies provided a never ending spectacle
at their closest io and callisto each appeared about half the size of the moon as seen from earth but that was the only thing they had in common
io was so close to lucifer that it took less than two days to race around its orbit and showed visible movement even in a matter of minutes
callisto at over four times io s distance required two mede days or sixteen earth ones to complete its leisurely circuit
the physical contrast between the two worlds was even more remarkable
deep frozen callisto had been almost unchanged by jupiter s conversion into a mini sun it was still a wasteland of shallow ice craters so closely packed that there was not a single spot on the entire satellite that had escaped from multiple impacts in the days when jupiter s enormous gravity field was competing with saturn s to gather up the debris of the outer solar system
since then apart from a few stray shots nothing had happened for several billion years
on io something was happening every week
as a local wit had remarked before the creation of lucifer it had been hell now it was hell warmed up
often poole would zoom into that burning landscape and look into the sulfurous throats of volcanoes that were continually reshaping an area larger than africa
sometimes incandescent fountains would soar briefly hundreds of kilometers into space like gigantic trees of fire growing on a lifeless world
as the floods of molten sulfur spread out from volcanoes and vents the versatile element changed through a narrow spectrum of reds and oranges and yellows when chameleon like it was transformed into its vari colored allotropes
before the dawn of the space age no one had ever imagined that such a world existed
fascinating though it was to observe it from his comfortable vantage point poole found it hard to believe that men had ever risked landing there where even robots feared to tread his main interest however was europa which at its closest appeared almost exactly the same size as earth s solitary moon but raced through its phases in only four days
though poole had been quite unconscious of the symbolism when he chose his private landscape it now seemed wholly appropriate that europa should hang in the sky above another great enigma the sphinx
even with no magnification when he requested the naked eye view poole could see how greatly europa had changed in the thousand years since discovery had set out for jupiter
the spider s web of narrow bands and lines that had once completely enveloped the smallest of the four galilean satellites had vanished except around the poles
here the global crust of kilometer thick ice remained unmelted by the warmth of europa s new sun elsewhere virgin oceans seethed and boiled in the thin atmosphere at what would have been comfortable room temperature on earth
it was also a comfortable temperature to the creatures who had emerged after the melting of the unbroken ice shield that had both trapped and protected them
orbiting spysats showing details only centimeters across had watched one europan species starting to evolve into an amphibious stage though they still spent much of their time underwater the europs had even begun the construction of simple buildings
that this could happen in a mere thousand years was astonishing but no one doubted that the explanation lay in the last and greatest of the monoliths the many kilometer long great wall standing on the shore of the sea of galilee
and no one doubted that in its own mysterious way it was watching over the experiment it had started on this world as it had done on earth four million years before

the madness of mankind miss pringle file indra my dear indra sorry i ve not even voice mailed you before usual excuse of course so i won t bother to give it
to answer your question yes i m now feeling quite at home at the grannymede but am spending less and less time there though i ve been enjoying the sky display i ve had piped into my suite
last night the io flux tube put on a fine performance that s a kind of lightning discharge between io and jupiter i mean lucifer
rather like earth s aurora but much more spectacular
discovered by the radio astronomers even before i was born
and talking about ancient times did you know that anubis has a sheriff
i think that s overdoing the frontier spirit
reminds me of the stories my grandfather used to tell me about arizona must try some of them on the medes
this may sound silly i m still not used to being in the bowman suite
i keep looking over my shoulder how do i spend my time
much the same as in africa tower
i m meeting the local intelligentsia though as you might expect they re rather thin on the ground hope no one is bugging this
and i ve interacted real and virtual with the educational system very good it seems though more technically oriented than you d approve
that s inevitable of course in this hostile environment
but it s helped me to understand why people live here
there s a challenge a sense of purpose if you like that i seldom found on earth
it s true that most of the medes were born here so don t know any other home
though they re usually too polite to say so they think that the home planet is becoming decadent
are you
and if so what are you terries as the locals call you going to do about it
one of the teenage classes i ve met hopes to wake you up
they re drawing up elaborate top secret plans for the invasion of earth
don t say i didn t warn you
i ve made one trip outside anubis into the so called night land where they never see lucifer
ten of us chandler two of goliath s crew six medes went into farside and chased the sun down to the horizon so it really was night
awesome much like polar winters on earth but with the sky completely black almost felt i was in space
we could see all the galileans beautifully and watched europa eclipse sorry occult io
of course the trip had been timed so we could observe this several of the smaller satellites were just also visible but the double star earth moon was much more conspicuous
did i feel homesick
frankly no though i miss my new friends back there and i m sorry i still haven t met dr khan though he s left several messages for me
i promise to do it in the next few days earth days not mede ones
best wishes to joe regards to danil if you know what s happened to him is he a real person again
and my love to yourself
store transmit back in poole s century a person s name often gave a clue to his her appearance but that was no longer true thirty generations later
dr theodore khan turned out to be a nordic blond who might have looked more at home in a viking longboat than ravaging the steppes of central asia however he would not have been too impressive in either role being less than a hundred and fifty centimeters tall
poole could not resist a little amateur psychoanalysis small people were often aggressive over achievers which from indra wallace s hints appeared to be a good description of ganymede s sole resident philosopher
khan probably needed these qualifications to survive in such a practically minded society
anubis city was far too small to boast a university campus a luxury which still existed on the other worlds though many believed that the telecommunications revolution had made it obsolete
instead it had something much more appropriate as well as centuries older an academy complete with a grove of olive trees that would have fooled plato himself until he had attempted to walk through it
indra s joke about departments of philosophy requiring no more equipment than blackboards clearly did not apply in this sophisticated environment
it s built to hold seven people said dr khan proudly when they had settled down on chairs obviously designed to be not too comfortable because that s the maximum one can efficiently interact with
and if you count the ghost of socrates it was the number present when phaedo delivered his famous address the one on the immortality of the soul khan was so obviously surprised that poole could not help laughing
i took a crash course in philosophy just before i graduated when the syllabus was planned someone decided that we hairy knuckled engineers should be exposed to a little culture i m delighted to hear it
that makes things so much easier
you know i still can t credit my luck
your arrival here almost tempts me to believe in miracles
i d even thought of going to earth to meet you has dear indra told you about my ah obsession no poole answered not altogether truthfully
dr khan looked very pleased he was clearly delighted to find a new audience
you may have heard me called an atheist but that s not quite true
atheism is unprovable so uninteresting
equally however unlikely it is we can never be certain that god once existed and has now shot off to infinity where no one can ever find him like gautama buddha i take no position on this subject
my field of interest is the psychopathology known as religion psychopathology
that s a harsh judgement amply justified by history
imagine that you re an intelligent extraterrestrial concerned only with verifiable truths
you discover a species which has divided itself into thousands no by now millions of tribal groups holding an incredible variety of beliefs about the origin of the universe and the way to behave in it
although many of them have ideas in common even when there s a ninety nine per cent overlap the remaining one per cent is enough to set them killing and torturing each other over trivial points of doctrine utterly meaningless to outsiders how to account for such irrational behavior
lucretius hit it on the nail when he said that religion was the by product of fear a reaction to a mysterious and often hostile universe
for much of human prehistory it may have been a necessary evil but why was it so much more evil than necessary and why did it survive when it was no longer necessary
i said evil and i mean it because fear leads to cruelty
the slightest knowledge of the inquisition makes one ashamed to belong to the human species one of the most revolting books ever published was the hammer of witches written by a couple of sadistic perverts and describing the tortures the church authorized encouraged
to extract confessions from thousands of harmless old women before it burned them alive
the pope himself wrote an approving foreword but most of the other religions with a few honorable exceptions were just as bad as christianity
even in your century little boys were kept chained and whipped until they d memorized whole volumes of pious gibberish and robbed of their childhood and manhood to become monks perhaps the most baffling aspect of the whole affair is how obvious madmen century after century would proclaim that they and they alone
had received messages from god
if all the messages had agreed that would have settled the matter
but of course they were wildly discordant which never prevented self styled messiahs from gathering hundreds sometimes millions of adherents who would fight to the death against equally deluded believers of a microscopically differing faith poole thought it was about time he got a word in edgeways
you ve reminded me of something that happened in my home town when i was a kid
a holy man quote unquote set up shop claimed he could work miracles and collected a crowd of devotees in next to no time
and they weren t ignorant or illiterate often they came from the best families
every sunday i used to see expensive cars parked round his ah temple the rasputin syndrome it s been called there are millions of such cases all through history in every country
and about one time in a thousand the cult survives for a couple of generations
what happened in this case well the competition was very unhappy and did its best to discredit him
wish i could remember his name he used a long indian one swami something or other but it turned out he came from alabama
one of his tricks was to produce holy objects out of thin air and hand them to his worshippers
as it happened our local rabbi was an amateur conjuror and gave public demonstrations showing exactly how it was done
didn t make the slightest difference the faithful said that their man s magic was real and the rabbi was just jealous at one time i m sorry to say mother took the rascal seriously it was soon after dad had run off which may have had something to do with it and dragged me to one of his sessions
i was only about ten but i thought i d never seen anyone so unpleasant looking
he had a beard that could have held several birds nests and probably did he sounds like the standard model
how long did he flourish three or four years
and then he had to leave town in a hurry he was caught running teenage orgies
of course he claimed he was using mystical soul saving techniques
and you won t believe this try me even then lots of his dupes still had faith in him
their god could do no wrong so he must have been framed framed sorry convicted by faked evidence sometimes used by the police to catch criminals when all else fails hmm
well your swami was perfectly typical i m rather disappointed
but he does help to prove my case that most of humanity has always been insane at least some of the time rather an unrepresentative sample one small flagstaff suburb true but i could multiply it by thousands not only in your century but all down the ages
there s never been anything however absurd that countless people weren t prepared to believe often so passionately that they d fight to the death rather than abandon their illusions
to me that s a good operational definition of insanity would you argue that anyone with strong religious beliefs was insane in a strictly technical sense yes if they really were sincere and not hypocrites
as i suspect ninety per cent were i m certain that rabbi berenstein was sincere and he was one of the sanest men i ever knew as well as one of the finest
and how do you account for this
the only real genius i ever met was dr chandra who led the hal project
i once had to go into his office there was no reply when i knocked and i thought it was unoccupied he was praying to a group of fantastic little bronze statues draped with flowers
one of them looked like an elephant another had more than the regular number of arms
i was quite embarrassed but luckily he didn t hear me and i tiptoed out
would you say he was insane you ve chosen a bad example genius often is
so let s say not insane but mentally impaired owing to childhood conditioning
the jesuits claimed give me a boy for six years and he is mine for life
if they d got hold of little chandra in time he d have been a devout catholic not a hindu possibly
but i m puzzled why were you so anxious to meet me
i m afraid i ve never been a devout anything
what have i got to do with all this slowly and with the obvious enjoyment of a man unburdening himself of a heavy long hoarded secret dr khan told him

apostate record poole hello frank
so you ve finally met ted
yes you could call him a crank if you define that as an enthusiast with no sense of humor
but cranks often get that way because they know a big truth can you hear my capitals
and no one will listen
i m glad you did and i suggest you take him quite seriously
you said you were surprised to see a pope s portrait prominently displayed in ted s apartment
that would have been his hero pius xx i m sure i mentioned him to you
look him up he s usually called the impius
it s a fascinating story and exactly parallels something that happened just before you were born
you must know how mikhail gorbachev the president of the soviet empire brought about its dissolution at the end of the twentieth century by exposing its crimes and excesses
he didn t intend to go that far he d hoped to reform it but that was no longer possible
we ll never know if pius xx had the same idea because he was assassinated by a demented cardinal soon after he d horrified the world by releasing the secret files of the inquisition
the religious were still shaken by the discovery of tma zero only a few decades earlier that had a great impact on pius xx and certainly influenced his actions
but you still haven t told me how ted that old cryptodeist thinks you can help him in his search for god
i believe he s still mad at him for hiding so successfully
better not say i told you that
on second thoughts why not
love indra
store transmit miss pringle record hello indra i ve had another session with dr ted though i ve still not told him just why you think he s angry with god
but i ve had some very interesting arguments no dialogues with him though he does most of the talking
never thought i d get into philosophy again after all these years of engineering
perhaps i had to go through them first to appreciate it
wonder how he d grade me as a student
yesterday i tried this line of approach to see his reaction
perhaps it s original though i doubt it
thought you d like to hear it will be interested in your comments
here s our discussion miss pringle copy audio 94
surely ted you can t deny that most of the greatest works of human art have been inspired by religious devotion
doesn t that prove something yes but not in a way that will give much comfort to any believers
from time to time people amuse themselves making lists of the biggests and greatests and bests i m sure that was a popular entertainment in your day it certainly was well there have been some famous attempts to do this with the arts
of course such lists can t establish absolute eternal values but they re interesting and show how tastes change from age to age the last list i saw it was on the earth artnet only a few years ago was divided into architecture music visual arts
i remember a few of the examples the parthenon the taj mahal bach s toccata and fugue was first in music followed by verdi s requiem mass
in art the mona lisa of course
then not sure of the order a group of buddha statues somewhere in ceylon and the golden death mask of young king tut
even if i could remember all the others which of course i can t it doesn t matter the important thing is their cultural and religious backgrounds
overall no single religion dominated except in music
and that could be due to a purely technological accident the organ and the other pre electronic musical instruments were perfected in the christianized west
it could have worked out quite differently if for example the greeks or the chinese had regarded machines as something more than toys
but what really settles the argument as far as i m concerned is the general consensus about the single greatest work of human art
over and over again in almost every listing it s angkor wat
yet the religion that inspired that has been extinct for centuries no one even knows precisely what it was except that it involved hundreds of gods not merely one wish i could have thrown that at dear old rabbi berenstein i m sure he d have had a good answer i don t doubt it
i wish i could have met him myself
and i m glad he never lived to see what happened to israel end audio
there you have it indra
wish the grannymede had angkor wat on its menu i ve never seen it but you can t have everything now the question you really wanted answered why is dr ted so delighted that i m here
as you know he s convinced that the key to many mysteries lies on europa where no one has been allowed to land for a thousand years
he thinks i may be an exception
he believes i have a friend there
yes dave bowman or whatever he s now become we know that he survived being drawn into the big brother monolith and somehow revisited earth afterwards
but there s more that i didn t know
very few people do because the medes are embarrassed to talk about it ted khan has spent years collecting the evidence and is now quite certain of the facts even though he can t explain them
on at least six occasions about a century apart reliable observers here in anubis have reported seeing an apparition just like the one that heywood floyd met aboard discovery
though not one of them knew about that incident they were all able to identify dave when they were shown his hologram
and there was another sighting aboard a survey ship that made a close approach to europa six hundred years ago
individually no one would take these cases seriously but altogether they make a pattern
ted s quite sure that dave bowman survives in some form presumably associated with the monolith we call the great wall
and he still has some interest in our affairs
though he s made no attempt at communication ted hopes we can make contact
he believes that i m the only human who can do it
i m still trying to make up my mind
tomorrow i ll talk it over with captain chandler
will let you know what we decide
love frank
store transmit indra 21
quarantine do you believe in ghosts dim certainly not but like every sensible man i m afraid of them
why do you ask if it wasn t a ghost it was the most vivid dream i ve ever had
last night i had a conversation with dave bowman poole knew that captain chandler would take him seriously when the occasion required nor was he disappointed
interesting but there s an obvious explanation
you ve been living here in the bowman suite for deus s sake
you told me yourself it feels haunted i m sure well ninety nine per cent sure that you re right and the whole thing was prompted by the discussions i ve been having with prof ted
have you heard the reports that dave bowman occasionally appears in anubis
about once every hundred years
just as he did to dr floyd aboard discovery after she d been reactivated what happened there
i ve heard vague stories but never taken them seriously dr khan does and so do i i ve seen the original recordings
floyd s sitting in my old chair when a kind of dust cloud forms behind him and shapes itself into dave though only the head has detail
then it gives that famous message warning him to leave who wouldn t have
but that was a thousand years ago
plenty of time to fake it what would be the point
khan and i were looking at it yesterday
i d bet my life it s authentic as a matter of fact i agree with you
and i have heard those reports chandler s voice trailed away and he looked slightly embarrassed
long time ago i had a girl friend here in anubis
she told me that her grandfather had seen bowman
i laughed i wonder if ted has that sighting on his list
could you put him in touch with your friend er rather not
we haven t spoken for years
for all i know she may be on the moon or mars
anyway why is professor ted interested that s what i really wanted to discuss with you sounds ominous
go ahead ted thinks that dave bowman or whatever he s become may still exist up there on europa after a thousand years well look at me one sample is poor statistics my maths prof used to say
but go on it s a complicated story or maybe a jigsaw with most of the pieces missing
but it s generally agreed that something crucial happened to our ancestors when that monolith appeared in africa four million years ago
it marks a turning point in prehistory the first appearance of tools and weapons and religion that can t be pure coincidence
the monolith must have done something to us surely it couldn t have just stood there passively accepting worship ted s fond of quoting a famous palaeontologist who said tma zero gave us an evolutionary kick in the pants
he argues that the kick wasn t in a wholly desirable direction
did we have to become so mean and nasty to survive
maybe we did as i understand him ted believes that there s something fundamentally wrong with the wiring of our brains which makes us incapable of consistent logical thinking
to make matters worse though all creatures need a certain amount of aggressiveness to survive we seem to have far more than is absolutely necessary
and no other animal tortures its fellows as we do
is this an evolutionary accident a piece of genetic bad luck
it s also widely agreed that tma one was planted on the moon to keep track of the project experiment whatever it was and to report to jupiter the obvious place for solar system mission control
that s why another monolith big brother was waiting there
had been waiting four million years when discovery arrived
agreed so far yes i ve always thought that was the most plausible theory now for the more speculative stuff
bowman was apparently swallowed up by big brother yet something of his personality seems to have survived
twenty years after that encounter with heywood floyd in the second jupiter expedition they had another contact aboard universe when floyd joined it for the 2 61 rendezvous with halley s comet
at least so he tells us in his memoirs though he was well over a hundred when he dictated them could have been senile not according to all the contemporary accounts
also perhaps even more significant his grandson chris had some equally weird experiences when galaxy made its forced landing on europa
and of course that s where the monolith or a monolith is right now
surrounded by europans i m beginning to see what dr ted s driving at
this is where we came in the whole cycle s starting over again
the europs are being groomed for stardom exactly everything fits
jupiter ignited to give them a sun to thaw out their frozen world
the warning to us to keep our distance presumably so that we wouldn t interfere with their development where have i heard that idea before
of course frank it goes back a thousand years to your own time
the prime directive
we still get lots of laughs from those old star trek programs did i ever tell you i once met some of the actors
they would have been surprised to see me now and i ve always had two thoughts about that non interference policy
the monolith certainly violated it with us back there in africa
one might argue that did have disastrous results so better luck next time on europa
poole laughed without much humor
khan used those exact words and what does he think we should do about it
above all where do you come into the picture first of all we must find what s really happening on europa and why
merely observing it from space is not enough what else can we do
all the probes the medes have sent there were blown up just before landing and ever since the mission to rescue galaxy crew carrying ships have been diverted by some field of force which no one can figure out
very interesting it proves that whatever is down there is protective but not malevolent
and this is the important point it must have some way of scanning what s on the way
it can distinguish between robots and humans more than i can do sometimes
go on well ted thinks there s one human being who might make it down to the surface of europa because his old friend is there and may have some influence with the powers that be captain dimitri chandler gave a long low whistle
and you re willing to risk it yes what have i got to lose one valuable shuttle craft if i know what you have in mind
is that why you ve been learning to fly falcon well now that you mention it the idea had occurred to me i ll have to think it over i ll admit i m intrigued but there are lots of problems knowing you i m sure they won t stand in the way once you ve decided to help me 22
venture miss pringle list priority messages from earth record dear indra i m not trying to be dramatic but this may be my last message from ganymede
by the time you receive it i will be on my way to europa
though it s a sudden decision and no one is more surprised than i am i ve thought it over very carefully
as you ll have guessed ted khan is largely responsible let him do the explaining if i don t come back
please don t misunderstand me in no way do i regard this as a suicide mission
but i m ninety per cent convinced by ted s arguments and he s aroused my curiosity so much that i d never forgive myself if i turned down this once in a lifetime opportunity
maybe i should say once in two lifetimes
i m flying goliath s little one person shuttle falcon how i d have loved to demonstrate her to my old colleagues back at the space administration
judging by past records the most likely outcome is that i ll be diverted away from europa before i can land
even this will teach me something and if it presumably the local monolith the great wall decides to treat me like the robot probes it s zapped in the past i ll never know
that s a risk i m prepared to take
thank you for everything and my very best to joe
love from ganymede and soon i hope from europa

falcon europa s about four hundred thousand kay from ganymede at the moment captain chandler informed poole
if you stepped on the gas thanks for teaching me that phrase
falcon could get you there in an hour
but i wouldn t recommend it our mysterious friend might be alarmed by anyone coming in that fast agreed and i want time to think
i m going to take several hours at least
and i m still hoping poole s voice trailed off into silence
hoping what that i can make some sort of contact with dave or whatever it is before i attempt to land yes it s always rude to drop in uninvited even with people you know let alone perfect strangers like the europs
perhaps you should take some gifts what did the old time explorers use
i believe mirrors and beads were once popular chandler s facetious tone did not disguise his real concern both for poole and for the valuable piece of equipment he proposed to borrow and for which the skipper of goliath was ultimately responsible
i m still trying to decide how we work this
if you come back a hero i want to bask in your reflected glory
but if you lose falcon as well as yourself what shall i say
that you stole the shuttle while we weren t looking
i m afraid no one would buy that story
ganymede traffic control s very efficient has to be
if you left without advance notice they d be on to you in a microsec well a millisecond
no way you could leave unless i file your flight plan ahead of time so this is what i propose to do unless i think of something better you re taking falcon out for a final qualification test everyone knows you ve already soloed
you ll go into a two thousand kilometer high orbit above europa nothing unusual about that people do it all the time and the local authorities don t seem to object estimated total flight time five hours plus or minus ten minutes
if you suddenly change your mind about coming home no one can do anything about it at least no one on ganymede
of course i ll make some indignant noises and say how astonished i am by such gross navigational errors etc etc
whatever will look best in the subsequent court of enquiry would it come to that
i don t want to do anything that will get you into trouble don t worry it s time there was a little excitement round here
but only you and i know about this plot try not to mention it to the crew i want them to have what was that other useful expression you taught me
plausible deniability thanks dim i really appreciate what you re doing
and i hope you ll never have to regret hauling me aboard goliath out round neptune poole found it hard to avoid arousing suspicion by the way he behaved towards his new crewmates as they prepared falcon for what was supposed to be a short routine flight
only he and chandler knew that it might be nothing of the kind
yet he was not heading into the totally unknown as he and dave bowman had done a thousand years ago
stored in the shuttle s memory were high resolution maps of europa showing details down to a few meters across
he knew exactly where he wished to go it only remained to see if he would be allowed to break the centuries long quarantine
24
escape manual control please are you sure frank quite sure falcon
thank you illogical though it seemed most of the human race had found it impossible not to be polite to its artificial children however simple minded they might be
whole volumes of psychology as well as popular guides how not to hurt your computer s feelings artificial intelligence real irritation were two of the best known titles had been written on the subject of man machine etiquette
long ago it had been decided that however inconsequential rudeness to robots might appear to be it should be discouraged
all too easily it could spread to human relationships as well
falcon was now in orbit just as her flight plan had promised at a safe two thousand kilometers above europa
the giant moon s crescent dominated the sky ahead and even the area not illuminated by lucifer was so brilliantly lit by the much more distant sun that every detail was clearly visible
poole needed no optical aid to see his planned destination on the still icy shore of the sea of galilee not far from the skeleton of the first spacecraft to land on this world
though the europans had long ago removed all its metal components the ill fated chinese ship still served as a memorial to its crew and it was appropriate that the only town even if an alien one on this whole world should have been named tsienville
poole had decided to come down over the sea and then fly very slowly towards tsienville hoping that this approach would appear friendly or at least non aggressive
though he admitted to himself that this was very na ve he could think of no better alternative
then suddenly just as he was dropping below the thousand kilometer level there was an interruption not of the kind he had hoped for but one which he had been expecting
this is ganymede control calling falcon
you have departed from your flight plan
please advise immediately what is happening it was hard to ignore such an urgent request but in the circumstances it seemed the best thing to do
exactly thirty seconds later and a hundred kilometers closer to europa ganymede repeated its message
once again poole ignored it but falcon did not
are you quite sure you want to do this frank asked the shuttle
though poole knew perfectly well that he was imagining it he would have sworn there was a note of anxiety in its voice
quite sure falcon
i know exactly what i m doing that was certainly untrue and any moment now further lying might be necessary to a more sophisticated audience
seldom activated indicator lights started to flash near the edge of the control board
poole smiled with satisfaction everything was going according to plan
this is ganymede control
do you receive me falcon
you are operating on manual override so i am unable to assist you
what is happening
you are still descending towards europa
please acknowledge immediately poole began to experience mild twinges of conscience
he thought he recognized the controller s voice and was almost certain that it was a charming lady he had met at a reception given by the mayor soon after his arrival at anubis
she sounded genuinely alarmed
suddenly he knew how to relieve her anxiety as well as to attempt something which he had previously dismissed as altogether too absurd
perhaps after all it was worth a try it certainly wouldn t do any harm and it might even work
this is frank poole calling from falcon
i am perfectly ok but something seems to have taken over the controls and is bringing the shuttle down towards europa
i hope you are receiving this i will continue to report as long as possible well he hadn t actually lied to the worried controller and one day he hoped he would be able to face her with a clear conscience
he continued to talk trying to sound as if he was completely sincere instead of skirting the edge of truth
this is frank poole aboard the shuttle falcon descending towards europa
i assume that some outside force has taken charge of my spacecraft and will be landing it safely dave this is your old shipmate frank
are you the entity that is controlling me
i have reason to think that you are on europa
if so i look forward to meeting you wherever or whatever you are not for a moment did he imagine there would be any reply even ganymede control appeared to be shocked into silence
and yet in a way he had an answer
falcon was still being permitted to descend towards the sea of galilee
europa was only fifty kilometers below with his naked eyes poole could now see the narrow black bar where the greatest of the monoliths stood guard if indeed it was doing that on the outskirts of tsienville
no human being had been allowed to come so close for a thousand years
25
fire in the deep for millions of years it had been an ocean world its hidden waters protected from the vacuum of space by a crust of ice
in most places the ice was kilometers thick but there were lines of weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart
then there had been a brief battle between two implacably hostile elements that came into direct contact on no other world in the solar system the war between sea and space always ended in the same stalemate the exposed water simultaneously boiled and froze repairing the armor of ice
the seas of europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without the influence of nearby jupiter
its gravity continually kneaded the core of the little world the forces that convulsed io were also working there though with much less ferocity
everywhere in the deep was evidence of that tug of war between planet and satellite in the continual roar and thunder of submarine earthquakes the shriek of gases escaping from the interior the infrasonic pressure waves of avalanches sweeping over the abyssal plains
by comparison with the tumultuous ocean that covered europa even the noisy seas of earth were muted
here and there scattered over the deserts of the deep were oases that would have amazed and delighted any terrestrial biologist
they extended for several kilometers around tangled masses of pipes and chimneys deposited by mineral brines gushing from the interior
often they created natural parodies of gothic castles from which black scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm as if driven by the beating of some mighty heart
and like blood they were the authentic sign of life itself
the boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above and formed islands of warmth on the sea bed
equally important they brought from europa s interior all the chemicals of life
such fertile oases offering food and energy in abundance had been discovered by the twentieth century explorers of earth s oceans
here they were present on an immensely larger scale and in far greater variety
delicate spidery structures that seemed to be the analogue of plants flourished in the tropical zones closest to the sources of heat
crawling among these were bizarre slugs and worms some feeding on the plants others obtaining their food directly from the mineral laden waters around them
at greater distances from the submarine fires around which all these creatures warmed themselves lived sturdier more robust organisms not unlike crabs or spiders
armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying one small oasis
unlike the palaeozoic terrestrial seas the europan abyss was not a stable environment so evolution had progressed with astonishing speed producing multitudes of fantastic forms
and all were under the same indefinite stay of execution sooner or later each fountain of life would weaken and die as the forces that powered it moved their focus elsewhere
all across the europan sea bed was evidence of such tragedies countless circular areas were littered with the skeletons and mineral encrusted remains of dead creatures where entire chapters of evolution had been deleted from the book of life
some had left as their only memorial huge empty shells like convoluted trumpets larger than a man
and there were clams of many shapes bivalves and even trivalves as well as spiral stone patterns many meters across exactly like the beautiful ammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from earth s oceans at the end of the cretaceous period
among the greatest wonders of the europan abyss were rivers of incandescent lava pouring from the calderas of submarine volcanoes
the pressure at these depths was so great that the water in contact with the red hot magma could not flash into steam so the two liquids co existed in an uneasy truce
there on another world and with alien actors something like the story of egypt had been played out long before the coming of man
as the nile had brought life to a narrow ribbon of desert so this river of warmth had vivified the europan deep
along its banks in a band never more than a few kilometers wide species after species had evolved and flourished and passed away
and some had left permanent monuments
often they were not easy to distinguish from the natural formations around the thermal vents and even when they were clearly not due to pure chemistry one would be hard put to decide whether they were the product of instinct or intelligence
on earth the termites reared condominiums almost as impressive as any found in the single vast ocean that enveloped this frozen world
along the narrow band of fertility in the deserts of the deep whole cultures and even civilizations might have risen and fallen armies might have marched or swum under the command of europan tamberlanes or napoleons
and the rest of their world would never have known for all their oases were as isolated from one another as the planets themselves the creatures who basked in the glow of the lava rivers and fed around the hot vents could not cross the hostile wilderness between their lonely islands
if they had ever produced historians and philosophers each culture would have been convinced that it was alone in the universe
yet even the space between the oases was not altogether empty of life there were hardier creatures who had dared its rigours
some were the europan analogues of fish streamlined torpedoes propelled by vertical tails steered by fins along their bodies
the resemblance to the most successful dwellers in earth s oceans was inevitable given the same engineering problems evolution must produce very similar answers
witness the dolphin and the shark superficially almost identical yet from far distant branches of the tree of life
there was however one very obvious difference between the fish of the europan seas and those in terrestrial oceans they had no gills for there was hardly a trace of oxygen to be extracted from the waters in which they swam
like the creatures around earth s own geothermal vents their metabolism was based on sulfur compounds present in abundance in this volcanic environment
and very few had eyes
apart from the flickering glow of lava outpourings and occasional bursts of bioluminescence from creatures seeking mates or hunters questing prey it was a lightless world
it was also a doomed one
not only were its energy sources sporadic and constantly shifting but the tidal forces that drove them were steadily weakening
even if they developed true intelligence the europans were trapped between fire and ice
barring a miracle they would perish with the final freezing of their little world
lucifer had wrought that miracle
26
tsienville in the final moments as he came in over the coast at a sedate hundred kilometers an hour poole wondered if there might be some last minute intervention
but nothing untoward happened even when he moved slowly along the black forbidding face of the great wall
it was the inevitable name for the europa monolith as unlike its little brothers on earth and moon it was lying horizontally and was more than twenty kilometers long
although it was literally billions of times greater in volume than tma zero and tma one its proportions were exactly the same that intriguing ratio 1 4 9 inspirer of so much numerological nonsense over the centuries
as the vertical face was almost ten kilometers high one plausible theory maintained that among its other functions the great wall served as a wind break protecting tsienville from the ferocious gales that occasionally roared in from the sea of galilee
they were much less frequent now that the climate had stabilized but a thousand years earlier they would have been a severe discouragement to any life forms emerging from the ocean
though he had fully intended to do so poole had never found time to visit the tycho monolith still top secret when he had left for jupiter and earth s gravity made its twin at olduvai inaccessible to him
but he had seen their images so often that they were much more familiar than the proverbial back of the hand and how many people he had often wondered would recognize the backs of their hands
apart from the enormous difference in scale there was absolutely no way of distinguishing the great wall from tma one and tma zero or for that matter the big brother monolith that discovery and the leonov had encountered orbiting jupiter
according to some theories perhaps crazy enough to be true there was only one archetypal monolith and all the others whatever their size were merely projections or images of it
poole recalled these ideas when he noticed the spotless unsullied smoothness of the great wall s towering ebon face
surely after so many centuries in such a hostile environment it should have collected a few patches of grime
yet it looked as immaculate as if an army of window cleaners had just polished every square centimeter
then he recalled that although everyone who had ever come to view tma one and tma zero felt an irresistible urge to touch their apparently pristine surfaces no one had ever succeeded
fingers diamond drills laser knives all skittered across the monoliths as if they were coated by an impenetrable film
or as if and this was another popular theory they were not quite in this universe but somehow separated from it by an utterly impassable fraction of a millimeter
he made one complete leisurely circuit of the great wall which remained totally indifferent to his progress
then he brought the shuttle still on manual in case ganymede control made any further attempts to rescue him to the outer limits of tsienville and hovered there looking for the best place to land
the scene through falcon s small panoramic window was wholly familiar to him he had examined it so often in ganymede recordings never imagining that one day he would be observing it in reality
the europs it seemed had no idea of town planning hundreds of hemispherical structures were scattered apparently at random over an area about a kilometer across
some were so small that even human children would feel cramped in them though others were big enough to hold a large family none was more than five meters high
and they were all made from the same material which gleamed a ghostly white in the double daylight
on earth the esquimaux had found the identical answer to the challenge of their own frigid materials poor environment tsienville s igloos were also made of ice
in lieu of streets there were canals as best suited creatures who were still amphibious and apparently returned to the water to sleep
also it was believed to feed and to mate though neither hypothesis had been proved
tsienville had been called venice made of ice and poole had to agree that it was an apt description
however there were no venetians in sight the place looked as if it had been deserted for years
and here was another mystery despite the fact that lucifer was fifty times brighter than the distant sun and was a permanent fixture in the sky the europs still seemed locked to an ancient rhythm of night and day
they returned to the ocean at sunset and emerged with the rising of the sun despite the fact that the level of illumination had changed by only a few per cent
perhaps there was a parallel on earth where the life cycles of many creatures were controlled as much by the feeble moon as the far more brilliant sun
it would be sunrise in another hour and then the inhabitants of tsienville would return to land and go about their leisurely affairs as by human standards they certainly were
the sulfur based biochemistry that powered the europs was not as efficient as the oxygen driven one that energized the vast majority of terrestrial animals
even a sloth could outrun a europ so it was difficult to regard them as potentially dangerous
that was the good news the bad news was that even with the best intentions on both sides attempts at communication would be extremely slow perhaps intolerably tedious
it was about time poole decided that he reported back to ganymede control
they must be getting very anxious and he wondered how his co conspirator captain chandler was dealing with the situation
falcon calling ganymede
as you can doubtless see i have er been brought to rest just above tsienville
there is no sign of hostility and as it s still solar night here all the europs are underwater
will call you again as soon as i m on the ground dim would have been proud of him poole thought as he brought falcon down gently as a snowflake on a smooth patch of ice
he was taking no chances with its stability and set the inertial drive to cancel all but a fraction of the shuttle s weight just enough he hoped to prevent it being blown away by any wind
he was on europa the first human in a thousand years
had armstrong and aldrin felt this sense of elation when eagle touched down on the moon
probably they were too busy checking their lunar module s primitive and totally unintelligent systems
falcon of course was doing all this automatically
the little cabin was now very quiet apart from the inevitable and reassuring murmur of well tempered electronics
it gave poole a considerable shock when chandler s voice obviously pre recorded interrupted his thoughts
so you made it
congratulations
as you know we re scheduled to return to the belt week after next but that should give you plenty of time after five days falcon knows what to do
she ll find her way home with or without you
so good luck miss pringle activate crypto program store hello dim thanks for that cheerful message
i feel rather silly using this program as if i m a secret agent in one of the spy melodramas that used to be so popular before i was born
still it will allow some privacy which may be useful
hope miss pringle has downloaded it properly of course miss p i m only joking
by the way i m getting a barrage of requests from all the news media in the solar system
please try to hold them off or divert them to dr ted
he ll enjoy handling them
since ganymede has me on camera all the time i won t waste breath telling you what i m seeing
if all goes well we should have some action in a few minutes and we ll know if it really was a good idea to let the europs find me already sitting here peacefully waiting to greet them when they come to the surface whatever happens it won t be as big a surprise to me as it was to dr chang and his colleagues when they landed here a thousand years ago
i played his famous last message again just before leaving ganymede
i must confess it gave me an eerie feeling couldn t help wondering if something like that could possibly happen again wouldn t like to immortalize myself the way poor chang did of course i can always lift off if something starts going wrong and here s an interesting thought that s just occurred to me
i wonder if the europs have any history any kind of records any memory of what happened just a few kilometers from here a thousand years ago
27
ice and vacuum this is dr chang calling from europa
i hope you can hear me especially dr floyd i know you re aboard leonov
i may not have much time aiming my suit antenna where i think you are please relay this information to earth
tsien was destroyed three hours ago
i m the only survivor
using my suit radio no idea if it has enough range but it s the only chance
please listen carefully there is life on europa
i repeat there is life on europa we landed safely checked all the systems and ran out the hoses so we could start pumping water into our propellant tanks immediately just in case we had to leave in a hurry
everything was going according to plan it seemed almost too good to be true
the tanks were half full when dr lee and i went out to check the pipe insulation
tsien stands stood about thirty meters from the edge of the grand canal
pipes went directly from it and down through the ice
very thin not safe to walk on
jupiter was quarter full and we had five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship
she looked like a christmas tree beautiful reflected on the ice lee saw it first a huge dark mass rising up from the depths
at first we thought it was a school of fish too large for a single organism then it started to break through the ice and began moving towards us
it looked rather like huge strands of wet seaweed crawling along the ground
lee ran back to the ship to get a camera i stayed to watch reporting over the radio
the thing moved so slowly i could easily outrun it
i was much more excited than alarmed
thought i knew what kind of creature it was i ve seen pictures of the kelp forests off california but i was quite wrong
i could tell it was in trouble
it couldn t possibly survive at a temperature a hundred and fifty below its normal environment
it was freezing solid as it moved forward bits were breaking off like glass but it was still advancing towards the ship a black tidal wave slowing down all the time
i was still so surprised that i couldn t think straight and i couldn t imagine what it was trying to do
even though it was heading towards tsien it still seemed completely harmless like well a small forest on the move
i remember smiling it reminded me of macbeth s birnam wood then i suddenly realized the danger
even if it was completely inoffensive it was heavy with all the ice it was carrying it must have weighed several tons even in this low gravity
and it was slowly painfully climbing up our landing gear the legs were beginning to buckle all in slow motion like something in a dream or a nightmare not until the ship started to topple did i realize what the thing was trying to do and then it was far too late
we could have saved ourselves if we d only switched off our lights
perhaps it s a phototrope its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight that filters down through the ice
or it could have been attracted like a moth to a candle
our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that europa has ever known even the sun itself then the ship crashed
i saw the hull split a cloud of snowflakes form as moisture condensed
all the lights went out except for one swinging back and forth on a cable a couple of meters above the ground
i don t know what happened immediately after that
the next thing i remember i was standing under the light beside the wreck of the ship with a fine powdering of fresh snow all around me
i could see my footsteps in it very clearly
i must have run there perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed the plant i still thought of it as a plant was motionless
i wondered if it had been damaged by the impact large sections as thick as a man s arms had splintered off like broken twigs
then the main trunk started to move again
it pulled away from the hull and began to crawl towards me
that was when i knew for certain that the thing was light sensitive i was standing immediately under the thousand watt lamp which had stopped swinging now
imagine an oak tree better still a banyan with its multiple trunks and roots flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground
it got to within five meters of the light then started to spread out until it had made a perfect circle around me
presumably that was the limit of its tolerance the point at which photo attraction turned to repulsion
after that nothing happened for several minutes i wondered if it was dead frozen solid at last
then i saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches
it was like watching a time lapse film of flowers opening
in fact i thought they were flowers each about as big as a man s head
delicate beautifully colored membranes started to unfold
even then it occurred to me that no one no thing could ever have seen these colors properly until we brought our lights our fatal lights to this world
tendrils stamens waving feebly
i walked over to the living wall that surrounded me so that i could see exactly what was happening
neither then or at any other time had i felt the slightest fear of the creature
i was certain that it was not malevolent if indeed it was conscious at all
there were scores of the big flowers in various stages of unfolding
now they reminded me of butterflies just emerging from the chrysalis wings crumpled still feeble i was getting closer and closer to the truth
but they were freezing dying as quickly as they formed
then one after another they dropped off from the parent buds
for a few moments they flopped around like fish stranded on dry land and at last i realized exactly what they were
those membranes weren t petals they were fins or their equivalent
this was the free swimming larval stage of the creature
probably it spends much of its life rooted on the sea bed then sends these mobile offspring in search of new territory
just like the corals of earth s oceans
i knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures
the beautiful colors were fading now to a drab brown
some of the petal fins had snapped off becoming brittle shards as they froze
but it was still moving feebly and as i approached it tried to avoid me
i wondered how it sensed my presence
then i noticed that the stamens as i d called them all carried bright blue dots at their tips
they looked like tiny star sapphires or the blue eyes along the mantle of a scallop aware of light but unable to form true images
as i watched the vivid blue faded the gems became dull ordinary stones dr floyd or anyone else who is listening i haven t much more time my life support system alarm has just sounded
but i ve almost finished
i knew then what i had to do
the cable to that thousand watt lamp was hanging almost to the ground
i gave it a few tugs and the light went out in a shower of sparks
i wondered whether it was too late
for a few minutes nothing happened
so i walked over to the wall of tangled branches around me and kicked it
slowly the creature started to unweave itself and to retreat back to the canal
i followed it all the way back to the water encouraging it with more kicks when it slowed down feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the time beneath my boots as it neared the canal it seemed to gain strength and energy as if it knew it was approaching its natural home
i wondered if it would survive to bud again
it disappeared through the surface leaving a few last dead larvae on the alien land
the exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab of protective ice sealed it from the vacuum above
then i walked back to the ship to see if there was anything to salvage i don t want to talk about that
i ve only two requests to make doctor
when the taxonomists classify this creature i hope they ll name it after me
and when the next ship comes home ask them to take our bones back to china
i ll lose power in a few minutes wish i knew whether anyone was receiving me
anyway i ll repeat this message as long as i can this is professor chang on europa reporting the destruction of the spaceship tsien
we landed beside the grand canal and set up our pumps at the edge of the ice 28
the little dawn miss pringle record here comes the sun
strange how quickly it seems to rise on this slowly turning world
of course of course the disc s so small that the whole of it pops above the horizon in no time not that it makes much difference to the light if you weren t looking in that direction you d never notice that there was another sun in the sky
but i hope the europs have noticed
usually it takes them less than five minutes to start coming ashore after the little dawn
wonder if they already know i m here and are scared no could be the other way round
perhaps they re inquisitive even anxious to see what strange visitor has come to tsienville
i rather hope so
here they come
hope your spysats are watching falcon s cameras recording how slowly they move
i m afraid it s going to be very boring trying to communicate with them even if they want to talk to me rather like the thing that overturned tsien but much smaller
they remind me of little trees walking on half a dozen slender trunks
and with hundreds of branches dividing into twigs which divide again and again
just like many of our general purpose robots what a long time it took us to realize that imitation humanoids were ridiculously clumsy and the proper way to go was with myriad of small manipulators
whenever we invent something clever we find that mother nature s already thought of it aren t the little ones cute like tiny bushes on the move
wonder how they reproduce budding
i hadn t realized how beautiful they are
almost as colorful as coral reef fish maybe for the same reasons to attract mates or fool predators by pretending to be something else did i say they looked like bushes
make that rose bushes they ve actually got thorns
must have a good reason for them
i m disappointed
they don t seem to have noticed me
they ll all heading into town as if a visiting spacecraft was an everyday occurrence only a few left maybe this will work
i suppose they can detect sound vibrations most marine creatures can though this atmosphere may be too thin to carry my voice very far falcon external speaker hello can you hear me
my name is frank poole ahem
i come in peace for all mankind makes me feel rather stupid but can you suggest anything better
and it will be good for the record nobody s taking the slightest notice
big ones and little ones they re all creeping towards their igloos wonder what they actually do when they get there perhaps i should follow
i m sure it would be perfectly safe i can move so much faster i ve just had an amusing flashback
all these creatures going in the same direction they look like the commuters who used to surge back and forth twice a day between home and office before electronics made it unnecessary
let s try again before they all disappear
hello there this is frank poole a visitor from planet earth
can you hear me
i hear you frank
this is dave
29
the ghosts in the machine frank poole s immediate reaction was one of utter astonishment followed by overwhelming joy
he had never really believed that he would make any kind of contact either with the europs or the monolith
indeed he had even had fantasies of kicking in frustration against that towering ebon wall and shouting angrily is there anybody home yet he should not have been so amazed some intelligence must have monitored his approach from ganymede and permitted him to land
he should have taken ted khan more seriously
dave he said slowly is that really you who else could it be
a part of his mind asked
yet it was not a foolish question
there was something curiously mechanical impersonal about the voice that came from the small speaker on falcon s control board
yes frank
i am dave there was a very brief pause then the same voice continued without any change of intonation hello frank
this is hal miss pringle record well indra dim i m glad i recorded all that otherwise you d never believe me
i guess i m still in a state of shock
first of all how should i feel about someone who tried to who did kill me even if it was a thousand years ago
but i understand now that hal wasn t to blame nobody was
there s a very good piece of advice i ve often found useful never attribute to malevolence what is merely due to incompetence i can t feel any anger towards a bunch of programmers i never knew who ve been dead for centuries
i m glad this is encrypted as i don t know how it should be handled and a lot that i tell you may turn out to be complete nonsense
i m already suffering from information overload and had to ask dave to leave me for a while after all the trouble i ve gone through to meet him
but i don t think i hurt his feelings i m not sure yet if he has any feelings what is he good question
well he really is dave bowman but with most of the humanity stripped away like ah like the synopsis of a book or a technical paper
you know how an abstract can give all the basic information but no hint of the author s personality
yet there were moments when i felt that something of the old dave was still there
i wouldn t go so far as to say he s pleased to meet me again moderately satisfied might be more like it for myself i m still very confused
like meeting an old friend after a long separation and finding that they re now a different person
well it has been a thousand years and i can t imagine what experiences he s known though as i ll show you presently he s tried to share some of them with me
and hal he s here too without question
most of the time there s no way i can tell which of them is speaking to me
aren t there examples of multiple personalities in the medical records
maybe it s something like that
i asked him how this had happened to them both and he they dammit halman
tried to explain
let me repeat i may have got it partly wrong but it s the only working hypothesis i have
of course the monolith in its various manifestations is the key no that s the wrong word didn t someone once say it was a kind of cosmic swiss army knife
you still have them i ve noticed though both switzerland and its army disappeared centuries ago
it s a general purpose device that can do anything it wants to
or was programmed to do back in africa four million years ago it gave us that evolutionary kick in the pants for better or for worse
then its sibling on the moon waited for us to climb out of the cradle
that we ve already guessed and dave s confirmed it
i said that he doesn t have many human feelings but he still has curiosity he wants to learn
and what an opportunity he s had
when the jupiter monolith absorbed him can t think of a better word it got more than it bargained for
though it used him apparently as a captured specimen and a probe to investigate earth he s also been using it
with hal s assistance and who should understand a super computer better than another one
he s been exploring its memory and trying to find its purpose
now this is something that s very hard to believe
the monolith is a fantastically powerful machine look what it did to jupiter
but it s no more than that
it s running on automatic it has no consciousness
i remember once thinking that i might have to kick the great wall and shout is there anyone there and the correct answer would have to be no one except dave and hal
worse still some of its systems may have started to fail dave even suggests that in a fundamental way it s become stupid
perhaps it s been left on its own for too long it s time for a service check
and he believes the monolith has made at least one misjudgement
perhaps that s not the right word it may have been deliberate carefully considered
in any event it s well truly awesome and terrifying in its implications
luckily i can show it to you so you can decide for yourselves
yes even though it happened a thousand years ago when leonov flew the second mission to jupiter
and all this time no one has ever guessed
i m certainly glad you got me fitted with the braincap
of course it s been invaluable i can t imagine life without it but now it s doing a job it was never designed for
and doing it remarkably well
it took halman about ten minutes to find how it worked and to set up an interface
now we have mind to mind contact which is quite a strain on me i can tell you
i have to keep asking them to slow down and use baby talk
or should i say baby think
i m not sure how well this will come through
it s a thousand year old recording of dave s own experience somehow stored in the monolith s enormous memory then retrieved by dave and injected into my braincap don t ask me exactly how and finally transferred and beamed to you by ganymede central
phew
hope you don t get a headache downloading it
over to dave bowman at jupiter early twenty first century 3
foamscape the million kilometer long tendrils of magnetic force the sudden explosion of radio waves the geysers of electrified plasma wider than the planet earth they were as real and clearly visible to him as the clouds banding the planet in multi hued glory
he could understand the complex pattern of their interactions and realized that jupiter was much more wonderful than anyone had ever guessed
even as he fell through the roaring heart of the great red spot with the lightning of its continent wide thunderstorms detonating under him he knew why it had persisted for centuries though it was made of gases far less substantial than those that formed the hurricanes of earth
the thin scream of hydrogen wind faded as he sank into the calmer depths and a sheet of waxen snowflakes some already coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam descended from the heights above
it was already warm enough for liquid water to exist but there were no oceans there this purely gaseous environment was too tenuous to support them
he descended through layer after layer of cloud until he entered a region of such clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than a thousand kilometers across
it was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of the great red spot and it held a secret that men had long guessed but never proved
skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriad of small sharply defined clouds all about the same size and patterned with similar red and brown mottling
they were small only as compared with the inhuman scale of their surroundings the very least would have covered a fair sized city
they were clearly alive for they were moving with slow deliberation along the flanks of the aerial mountains browsing off their slopes like colossal sheep
and they were calling to each other in the meter band their radio voices faint but clear against the cracklings and concussions of jupiter itself
nothing less than living gasbags they floated in the narrow zone between freezing heights and scorching depths
narrow yes but a domain far larger than all the biosphere of earth
they were not alone
moving swiftly among them were other creatures so small that they could easily have been overlooked
some of them bore an almost uncanny resemblance to terrestrial aircraft and were of about the same size
but they too were alive perhaps predators perhaps parasites perhaps even herdsmen
a whole new chapter of evolution as alien as that which he had glimpsed on europa was opening before him
there were jet propelled torpedoes like the squids of the terrestrial oceans hunting and devouring the huge gas bags
but the balloons were not defenceless some of them fought back with electric thunderbolts and with clawed tentacles like kilometer long chainsaws
there were even stranger shapes exploiting almost every possibility of geometry bizarre translucent kites tetrahedra spheres polyhedra tangles of twisted ribbons
the gigantic plankton of the jovian atmosphere they were designed to float like gossamer in the uprising currents until they had lived long enough to reproduce then they would be swept down into the depths to be carbonized and recycled in a new generation
he was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of earth and though he saw many wonders nothing there hinted of intelligence
the radio voices of the great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or of fear
even the hunters who might have been expected to develop higher degrees of organization were like the sharks in earth s oceans mindless automata
and for all its breathtaking size and novelty the biosphere of jupiter was a fragile world a place of mists and foam of delicate silken threads and paper thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed by lightning in the upper atmosphere
few of its constructs were more substantial than soap bubbles its most awesome predators could be torn to shreds by even the feeblest of terrestrial carnivores
like europa but on a vastly grander scale jupiter was an evolutionary cul de sac
intelligence would never emerge here even if it did it would be doomed to a stunted existence
a purely aerial culture might develop but in an environment where fire was impossible and solids scarcely existed it could never even reach the stone age

nursery miss pringle record well indra dim i hope that came through in good shape i still find it hard to believe
all those fantastic creatures surely we should have detected their radio voices even if we couldn t understand them
wiped out in a moment so that jupiter could be made into a sun
and now we can understand why
it was to give the europs their chance
what pitiless logic is intelligence the only thing that matters
i can see some long arguments with ted khan over this the next question is will the europs make the grade or will they remain forever stuck in the kindergarten not even that the nursery
though a thousand years is a very short time one would have expected some progress but according to dave they re exactly the same now as when they left the sea
perhaps that s the trouble they still have one foot or one twig
in the water
and here s another thing we got completely wrong
we thought they went back into the water to sleep
it s just the other way round they go back to eat and sleep when they come on land
as we might have guessed from their structure that network of branches they re plankton feeders
i asked dave what about the igloos they ve built
aren t they a technological advance and he said not really they re only adaptations of structures they make on the sea bed to protect themselves from various predators especially something like a flying carpet as big as a football field
there s one area though where they have shown initiative even creativity
they re fascinated by metals presumably because they don t exist in pure form in the ocean
that s why tsien was stripped the same thing s happened to the occasional probes that have come down in their territory
what do they do with the copper and beryllium and titanium they collect
nothing useful i m afraid
they pile it all together in one place in a fantastic heap that they keep reassembling
they could be developing an aesthetic sense i ve seen worse in the museum of modem art
but i ve got another theory did you ever hear of cargo cults
during the twentieth century some of the few primitive tribes that still existed made imitation aeroplanes out of bamboo in the hope of attracting the big birds in the sky that occasionally brought them wonderful gifts
perhaps the europs have the same idea
now that question you keep asking me what is dave
and how did he and hal become whatever it is they are now
the quick answer of course is that they re both emulations simulations in the monolith s gigantic memory
most of the time they re inactivated when i asked dave about this he said he d been awake his actual word for only fifty years altogether in the thousand since his er metamorphosis
when i asked if he resented this takeover of his life he said why should i resent it
i am performing my functions perfectly yes that sounds exactly like hal
but i believe it was dave if there s any distinction now
remember that swiss army knife analogy
halman is one of this cosmic knife s myriad of components
but he s not a completely passive tool when he s awake he has some autonomy some independence presumably within limits set by the monolith s overriding control
during the centuries he s been used as a kind of intelligent probe to examine jupiter as you ve just seen as well as ganymede and the earth
that confirms those mysterious events in florida reported by dave s old girl friend and the nurse who was looking after his mother just moments before her death as well as the encounters in anubis city
and it also explains another mystery
i asked dave directly why was i allowed to land on europa when everyone else has been turned away for centuries
i fully expected to be the answer s ridiculously simple
the monolith uses dave halman from time to time to keep an eye on us
dave knew all about my rescue even saw some of the media interviews i made on earth and on ganymede
i must say i m still a little hurt he made no attempt to contact me
but at least he put out the welcome mat when i did arrive dim i still have forty eight hours before falcon leaves with or without me
i don t think i ll need them now i ve made contact with halman we can keep in touch just as easily from anubis if he wants to do so
and i m anxious to get back to the grannymede as quickly as possible
falcon s a fine little spacecraft but her plumbing could be improved it s beginning to smell in here and i m itching for a shower
look forward to seeing you and especially ted khan
we have much to talk about before i return to earth
store transmit v termination the toil of all that be heals not the primal fault it rains into the sea and still the sea is salt

a gentleman of leisure on the whole it had been an interesting but uneventful three decades punctuated by the joys and sorrows which time and fate bring to all mankind
the greatest of those had been wholly unexpected in fact before he left for ganymede poole would have dismissed the very idea as preposterous
there is much truth in the saying that absence makes the heart grow fonder
when he and indra wallace met again they discovered that despite their bantering and occasional disagreements they were closer than they had imagined
one thing led to another including to their mutual joy dawn wallace and martin poole
it was rather late in life to start a family quite apart from that little matter of a thousand years and professor anderson had warned them that it might be impossible
or even worse you were lucky in more ways than you realize he told poole
radiation damage was surprisingly low and we were able to make all essential repairs from your intact dna
but until we do some more tests i can t promise genetic integrity
so enjoy yourselves but don t start a family until i give the ok the tests had been time consuming and as anderson had feared further repairs were necessary
there was one major set back something that could never have lived even if it had been allowed to go beyond the first few weeks after conception but martin and dawn were perfect with just the right number of heads arms and legs
they were also handsome and intelligent and barely managed to escape being spoiled by their doting parents who continued to be the best of friends when after fifteen years each opted for independence again
because of their social achievement rating they would have been permitted indeed encouraged to have another child but they decided not to put any more of a burden on their astonishingly good luck
one tragedy had shadowed poole s personal life during this period and indeed had shocked the whole solar community
captain chandler and his entire crew had been lost when the nucleus of a comet they were reconnoitring exploded suddenly destroying goliath so completely that only a few fragments were ever located
such explosions caused by reactions among unstable molecules which existed at very low temperatures were a well known danger to comet collectors and chandler had encountered several during his career
no one would ever know the exact circumstances which caused so experienced a spaceman to be taken by surprise
poole missed chandler very badly he had played a unique role in his life and there was no one to replace him no one except dave bowman with whom he had shared so momentous an adventure
he and chandler had often made plans to go into space together again perhaps all the way out to the oort cloud with its unknown mysteries and its remote but inexhaustible wealth of ice
yet some conflict of schedules had always upset their plans so this was a wished for future that would never exist
another long desired goal poole had managed to achieve despite doctor s orders
he had been down to earth and once was quite enough
the vehicle in which he had travelled looked almost identical to the wheelchairs used by the luckier paraplegics of his own time
it was motorized and had balloon tyres which allowed it to roll over reasonably smooth surfaces
however it could also fly at an altitude of about twenty centimeters on an aircushion produced by a set of small but very powerful fans
poole was surprised that so primitive a technology was still in use but inertia control devices were too bulky for such small scale applications
seated comfortably in his hoverchair he was scarcely conscious of his increasing weight as he descended into the heart of africa though he did notice some difficulty in breathing he had experienced far worse during his astronaut training
what he was not prepared for was the blast of furnace heat that smote him as he rolled out of the gigantic sky piercing cylinder that formed the base of the tower
yet it was still morning what would it be like at noon
he had barely accustomed himself to the heat when his sense of smell was assailed
a myriad odors none unpleasant but all unfamiliar clamoured for his attention
he closed his eyes for a few minutes in an attempt to avoid overloading his input circuits
before he had decided to open them again he felt some large moist object palpating the back of his neck
say hello to elizabeth said his guide a burly young man dressed in traditional great white hunter garb much too smart to have seen any real use she s our official greeter poole twisted round in his chair and found himself looking into the soulful eyes of a baby elephant
hello elizabeth he answered rather feebly
elizabeth lifted her trunk in salute and emitted a sound not usually heard in polite society though poole felt sure it was well intentioned
altogether he spent less than an hour on planet earth skirting the edge of a jungle whose stunted trees compared unfavorably with skyland s and encountering much of the local fauna
his guides apologized for the friendliness of the lions who had been spoilt by tourists but the malevolent expressions of the crocodiles more than compensated here was nature raw and unchanged
before he returned to the tower poole risked taking a few steps away from his hoverchair
he realized that this would be the equivalent of carrying his own weight on his back but that did not seem an impossible feat and he would never forgive himself unless he attempted it
it was not a good idea perhaps he should have tried it in a cooler climate
after no more than a dozen steps he was glad to sink back into the luxurious clutches of the chair
that s enough he said wearily
let s go back to the tower as he rolled into the elevator lobby he noticed a sign which he had somehow overlooked during the excitement of his arrival
it read welcome to africa
in wildness is the preservation of the world
henry david thoreau 1817 1862 observing poole s interest the guide asked did you know him it was the sort of question poole heard all too often and at the moment he did not feel equipped to deal with it
i don t think so he answered wearily as the great doors closed behind them shutting out the sights scents and sounds of mankind s earliest home
his vertical safari had satisfied his need to visit earth and he did his best to ignore the various aches and pains acquired there when he returned to his apartment at level 1 a prestigious location even in this democratic society
indra however was mildly shocked by his appearance and ordered him straight to bed
just like antaeus but in reverse she muttered darkly
who asked poole there were times when his wife s erudition was a little overwhelming but he had determined never to let it give him an inferiority complex
son of the earth goddess gaea
hercules wrestled with him but every time he was thrown to the ground antaeus renewed his strength who won hercules of course by holding antaeus in the air so ma couldn t recharge his batteries well i m sure it won t take me long to recharge mine
and i ve learned one lesson
if i don t get more exercise i may have to move up to lunar gravity level poole s good resolution lasted a full month every morning he went for a brisk five kilometer walk choosing a different level of the africa tower each day
some floors were still vast echoing deserts of metal which would probably never be occupied but others had been landscaped and developed over the centuries in a bewildering variety of architectural styles
many were borrowings from past ages and cultures others hinted at futures which poole would not care to visit
at least there was no danger of boredom and on many of his walks he was accompanied at a respectful distance by small groups of friendly children
they were seldom able to keep up with him for long
one day as poole was striding down a convincing though sparsely populated imitation of the champs elys es he suddenly spotted a familiar face
danil
he called the other man took not the slightest notice even when poole called again more loudly
don t you remember me danil and now that he had caught up with him poole did not have the slightest doubt of his identity looked genuinely baffled
i m sorry he said
you re commander poole of course
but i m sure we ve never met before now it was poole s turn to be embarrassed
stupid of me he apologized
must have mistaken you for someone else
have a good day he was glad of the encounter and was pleased to know that danil was back in normal society
whether his original crime had been axe murders or overdue library books should no longer be the concern of his one time employer the account had been settled the books closed
although poole sometimes missed the cops and robbers dramas he had often enjoyed in his youth he had grown to accept the current wisdom excessive interest in pathological behavior was itself pathological
with the help of miss pringle mk iii poole had been able to schedule his life so that there were even occasional blank moments when he could relax and set his braincap on random search scanning his areas of interest
outside his immediate family his chief concerns were still among the moons of jupiter lucifer not least because he was recognized as the leading expert on the subject and a permanent member of the europa committee
this had been set up almost a thousand years ago to consider what if anything could and should be done about the mysterious satellite
over the centuries it had accumulated a vast amount of information going all the way back to the voyager flybys of 1979 and the first detailed surveys from the orbiting galileo spacecraft of 1996
like most long lived organizations the europa committee had become slowly fossilized and now met only when there was some new development
it had woken up with a start after halman s reappearance and appointed an energetic new chairperson whose first act had been to co opt poole
though there was little that he could contribute that was not already recorded poole was very happy to be on the committee
it was obviously his duty to make himself available and it also gave him an official position he would otherwise have lacked
previously his status was what had once been called a national treasure which he found faintly embarrassing
although he was glad to be supported in luxury by a world wealthier than all the dreams of war ravaged earlier ages could have imagined he felt the need to justify his existence
he also felt another need which he seldom articulated even to himself
halman had spoken to him if only briefly at their strange encounter two decades ago
poole was certain that if he wished halman could easily do so again
were all human contacts no longer of interest to him
he hoped that was not the case yet that might be one explanation of his silence
he was frequently in touch with theodore khan as active and acerbic as ever and now the europa committee s representative on ganymede
ever since poole had returned to earth ted had been trying in vain to open a channel of communication with bowman
he could not understand why long lists of important questions on subjects of vital philosophical and historic interest received not even brief acknowledgements
does the monolith keep your friend halman so busy that he can t talk to me he complained to poole
what does he do with his time anyway it was a very reasonable question and the answer came like a thunderbolt out of a cloudless sky from bowman himself as a perfectly commonplace vidphone call

contact hello frank
this is dave
i have a very important message for you
i assume that you are now in your suite in africa tower
if you are there please identify yourself by giving the name of our instructor in orbital mechanics
i will wait for sixty seconds and if there is no reply will try again in exactly one hour that minute was hardly long enough for poole to recover from the shock
he felt a brief surge of delight as well as astonishment before another emotion took over
glad though he was to hear from bowman again that phrase a very important message sounded distinctly ominous
at least it was fortunate poole told himself that he s asked for one of the few names i can remember
yet who could forget a scot with a glasgow accent so thick it had taken them a week to master it
but he had been a brilliant lecturer once you understood what he was saying
dr gregory mcvitty accepted
now please switch on your braincap receiver
it will take three minutes to download this message
do not attempt to monitor i am using ten to one compression
i will wait two minutes before starting how is he managing to do this
poole wondered
jupiter lucifer was now over fifty light minutes away so this message must have left almost an hour ago
it must have been sent with an intelligent agent in a properly addressed package on the ganymede earth beam but that would have been a trivial feat to halman with the resources he had apparently been able to tap inside the monolith
the indicator light on the brainbox was flickering
the message was coming through
at the compression halman was using it would take half an hour for poole to absorb the message in real time
but he needed only ten minutes to know that his peaceful life style had come to an abrupt end 34
judgement in a world of universal and instantaneous communication it was very difficult to keep secrets
this was a matter poole decided immediately for face to face discussion
the europa committee had grumbled but all its members had assembled in his apartment
there were seven of them the lucky number doubtless suggested by the phases of the moon that had always fascinated mankind
it was the first time poole had met three of the committee s members though by now he knew them all more thoroughly than he could possibly have done in a pre braincapped lifetime
chairperson oconnor members of the committee i d like to say a few words only a few i promise
before you download the message i ve received from europa
and this is something i prefer to do verbally that s more natural for me i m afraid i ll never be quite at ease with direct mental transfer as you all know dave bowman and hal have been stored as emulations in the monolith on europa
apparently it never discards a tool it once found useful and from time to time it activates halman to monitor our affairs when they begin to concern it
as i suspect my arrival may have done though perhaps i flatter myself but halman isn t just a passive tool
the dave component still retains something of its human origins even emotions
and because we were trained together shared almost everything for years he apparently finds it much easier to communicate with me than with anyone else
i would like to think he enjoys doing it but perhaps that s too strong a word he s also curious inquisitive and perhaps a little resentful of the way he s been collected like a specimen of wildlife
though that s probably what we are from the viewpoint of the intelligence that created the monolith and where is that intelligence now
halman apparently knows the answer and it s a chilling one as we always suspected the monolith is part of a galactic network of some kind
and the nearest node the monolith s controller or immediate superior is 45 light years away much too close for comfort
this means that the report on us and our affairs that was transmitted early in the twenty first century was received half a millennium ago
if the monolith s let s say supervisor replied at once any further instructions should be arriving just about now and that s exactly what seems to be happening
during the last few days the monolith has been receiving a continuous string of messages and has been setting up new programs presumably in accordance with these unfortunately halman can only make guesses about the nature of those instructions
as you ll gather when you ve downloaded this tablet he has some limited access to many of the monolith s circuits and memory banks and can even carry on a kind of dialogue with it
if that s the right word since you need two people for that
i still can t really grasp the idea that the monolith for all its powers doesn t possess consciousness doesn t even know that it exists halman s been brooding over the problem for a thousand years on and off and has come to the same answer that most of us have done
but his conclusion must surely carry far more weight because of his inside knowledge sorry
i wasn t intending to make a joke but what else could you call it whatever went to the trouble of creating us or at least tinkering with our ancestors minds and genes is deciding what to do next
and halman is pessimistic
no that s an exaggeration
let s say he doesn t think much of our chances but is now too detached an observer to be unduly worried
the future the survival
of the human race isn t much more than an interesting problem to him but he s willing to help poole suddenly stopped talking to the surprise of his intent audience
that s strange
i ve just had an amazing flashback
i m sure it explains what s happening
please bear with me dave and i were walking together one day along the beach at the cape a few weeks before launch when we noticed a large beetle lying on the sand
as often happens it had fallen on its back and was waving its legs in the air struggling to get right way up i ignored it we were engaged in some complicated technical discussion but not dave
he stepped aside and carefully flipped it over with his shoe
as it flew away i commented are you sure that was a good idea
now it will go off and chomp somebody s prize chrysanthemums
and he answered maybe you re right
but i d like to give it the benefit of the doubt my apologies i d promised to say only a few words
but i m very glad i remembered that incident i really believe it puts halman s message in the right perspective
he s giving the human race the benefit of the doubt now please check your braincaps
this is a high density recording top of the u v
band channel 11
make yourselves comfortable but be sure you re free line of sight
here we go 35
council of war no one asked for a replay
once was sufficient
there was a brief silence when the playback finished then chairperson dr oconnor removed her braincap massaged her shining scalp and said slowly you taught me a phrase from your period that seems very appropriate now
this is a can of worms but only bowman halman has opened it said one of the committee members
does he really understand the operation of something as complex as the monolith
or is this whole scenario a figment of his imagination i don t think he has much imagination dr oconnor answered
and everything checks perfectly
especially the reference to nova scorpio
we assumed that was an accident apparently it was a judgement first jupiter now scorpio said dr kraussman the distinguished physicist who was popularly regarded as a reincarnation of the legendary einstein
a little plastic surgery it was rumored had also helped
who will be next in line we always guessed said the chair that the tmas were monitoring us she paused for a moment then added ruefully what bad what incredibly bad
luck that the fmal report went off just after the very worst period in human history there was another silence
everyone knew that the twentieth century had often been branded the century of torture poole listened without interrupting while he waited for some consensus to emerge
not for the first time he was impressed by the quality of the committee
no one was trying to prove a pet theory score debating points or inflate an ego he could not help drawing a contrast with the often bad tempered arguments he had heard in own time between space agency engineers and administrators congressional staffs and industrial executives
yes the human race had undoubtedly improved
the braincap had not only helped to weed out misfits but had enormously increased the efficiency of education
yet there had also been a loss there were very few memorable characters in this society
offhand he could think of only four indra captain chandler dr khan and the dragon lady of wistful memory
the chairperson let the discussion flow smoothly back and forth until everyone had had a say then began her summing up
the obvious first question how seriously should we take this threat isn t worth wasting time on
even if it s a false alarm or a misunderstanding it s potentially so grave that we must assume it s real until we have absolute proof to the contrary
agreed good
and we don t know how much time we have
so we must assume that the danger is immediate
perhaps halman may be able to give us some further warning but by then it may be too late so the only thing we have to decide is how can we protect ourselves against something as powerful as the monolith
look what happened to jupiter
and apparently nova scorpio i m sure that brute force would be useless though perhaps we should explore that option
dr kraussman how long would it take to build a super bomb assuming that the designs still exist so that no research is necessary oh perhaps two weeks
thermonuclear weapons are rather simple and use common materials after all they made them back in the second millennium
but if you wanted something sophisticated say an antimatter bomb or a mini black hole well that might take a few months thank you could you start looking into it
but as i ve said i don t believe it would work surely something that can handle such powers must also be able to protect itself against them
so any other suggestions can we negotiate one councillor asked not very hopefully
with what or whom kraussman answered
as we ve discovered the monolith is essentially a pure mechanism doing just what it s been programmed to do
perhaps that program is flexible enough to allow of changes but there s no way we can tell
and we certainly can t appeal to head office that s half a thousand light years away poole listened without interrupting there was nothing he could contribute to the discussion and indeed much of it was completely over his head
he began to feel an insidious sense of depression would it have been better he wondered not to pass on this information
then if it was a false alarm no one would be any the worse
and if it was not well humanity would still have peace of mind before whatever inescapable doom awaited it
he was still mulling over these gloomy thoughts when he was suddenly alerted by a familiar phrase
a quiet little member of the committee with a name so long and difficult that poole had never been able to remember still less pronounce it had abruptly dropped just two words into the discussion
trojan horse there was one of those silences generally described as pregnant then a chorus of why didn t i think of that of course very good idea until the chairperson for the first time in the session had to call for order
thank you professor thirugnanasampanthamoorthy said dr oconnor without missing a beat
would you like to be more specific certainly
if the monolith is indeed as everyone seems to think essentially a machine without consciousness and hence with only limited self monitoring ability we may already have the weapons that can defeat it
locked up in the vault and a delivery system halman precisely just a minute dr t we know nothing absolutely nothing about the monolith s architecture
how can we be sure that anything our primitive species ever designed would be effective against it we can t but remember this
however sophisticated it is the monolith has to obey exactly the same universal laws of logic that aristotle and boole formulated centuries ago
that s why it may no should
be vulnerable to the things locked up in the vault
we have to assemble them in such a way that at least one of them will work
it s our only hope unless anybody can suggest a better alternative excuse me said poole finally losing patience
will someone kindly tell me what and where is this famous vault you re talking about 36
chamber of horrors history is full of nightmares some natural some manmade
by the end of the twenty first century most of the natural ones smallpox the black death aids the hideous viruses lurking in the african jungle had been eliminated or at least brought under control by the advance of medicine
however it was never wise to underestimate the ingenuity of mother nature and no one doubted that the future would still have unpleasant biological surprises in store for mankind
it seemed a sensible precaution therefore to keep a few specimens of all these horrors for scientific study carefully guarded of course so that there was no possibility of them escaping and again wreaking havoc on the human race
but how could one be absolutely sure that there was no danger of this happening
there had been understandably quite an outcry in the late twentieth century when it was proposed to keep the last known smallpox viruses at disease control centers in the united states and russia
however unlikely it might be there was a finite possibility that they might be released by such accidents as earthquakes equipment failures or even deliberate sabotage by terrorist groups
a solution that satisfied everyone except a few preserve the lunar wilderness extremists was to ship them to the moon and to keep them in a laboratory at the end of a kilometer long shaft drilled into the isolated mountain pico one of the most prominent features of the mare imbrium
and here over the years they were joined by some of the most outstanding examples of misplaced human ingenuity indeed insanity
there were gases and mists that even in microscopic doses caused slow or instant death
some had been created by religious cultists who though mentally deranged had managed to acquire considerable scientific knowledge
many of them believed that the end of the world was at hand when of course only their followers would be saved
in case god was absent minded enough not to perform as scheduled they wanted to make sure that they could rectify his unfortunate oversight
the first assaults of these lethal cultists were made on such vulnerable targets as crowded subways world fairs sports stadiums pop concerts tens of thousands were killed and many more injured before the madness was brought under control in the early twenty first century
as often happens some good came out of evil because it forced the world s law enforcement agencies to co operate as never before even rogue states which had promoted political terrorism were unable to tolerate this random and wholly unpredictable variety
the chemical and biological agents used in these attacks as well as in earlier forms of warfare joined the deadly collection in pico
their antidotes when they existed were also stored with them
it was hoped that none of this material would ever concern humanity again but it was still available under heavy guard if it was needed in some desperate emergency
the third category of items stored in the pico vault although they could be classified as plagues had never killed or injured anyone directly
they had not even existed before the late twentieth century but in a few decades they had done billions of dollars worth of damage and often wrecked lives as effectively as any bodily illness could have done
they were the diseases which attacked mankind s newest and most versatile servant the computer
taking names from the medical dictionaries viruses prions tapeworms they were programs that often mimicked with uncanny accuracy the behavior of their organic relatives
some were harmless little more than playful jokes contrived to surprise or amuse computer operators by unexpected messages and images on their visual displays
others were far more malicious deliberately designed agents of catastrophe
in most cases their purpose was entirely mercenary they were the weapons that sophisticated criminals used to blackmail the banks and commercial organizations that now depended utterly upon the efficient operation of their computer systems
on being warned that their data banks would be erased automatically at a certain time unless they transferred a few megadollars to some anonymous offshore number most victims decided not to risk possibly irreparable disaster
they paid up quietly often to avoid public or even private embarrassment without notifying the police
this understandable desire for privacy made it easy for the network highwaymen to conduct their electronic holdups even when they were caught they were treated gently by legal systems which did not know how to handle such novel crimes and after all they had not really hurt anyone had they
indeed after they had served their brief sentences many of the perpetrators were quietly hired by their victims on the old principle that poachers make the best game keepers
these computer criminals were driven purely by greed and certainly did not wish to destroy the organizations they preyed upon no sensible parasite kills its host
but there were other and much more dangerous enemies of society at work usually they were maladjusted individuals typically adolescent males working entirely alone and of course in complete secrecy
their aim was to create programs which would simply create havoc and confusion when they had been spread over the planet by the world wide cable and radio networks or on physical carriers such as diskettes and cd roms
then they would enjoy the resulting chaos basking in the sense of power it gave their pitiful psyches
sometimes these perverted geniuses were discovered and adopted by national intelligence agencies for their own secretive purposes usually to break into the data banks of their rivals
this was a fairly harmless line of employment as the organizations concerned did at least have some sense of civic responsibility
not so the apocalyptic sects who were delighted to discover this new armory holding weapons far more effective and more easily disseminated than gas or germs
and much more difficult to counter since they could be broadcast instantaneously to millions of offices and homes
the collapse of the new york havana bank in 2 5 the launching of indian nuclear missiles in 2 7 luckily with their warheads unactivated the shutdown of pan european air traffic control in 2 8 the paralysis of the north american telephone network in that same year all these were cult inspired rehearsals for doomsday
thanks to brilliant feats of counterintelligence by normally uncooperative and even warring national agencies this menace was slowly brought under control
at least so it was generally believed there had been no serious attacks at the very foundations of society for several hundred years
one of the chief weapons of victory had been the braincap though there were some who believed that this achievement had been bought at too great a cost
though arguments over the freedom of the individual versus the duties of the state were old when plato and aristotle attempted to codify them and would probably continue until the end of time some consensus had been reached in the third millennium
it was generally agreed that communism was the most perfect form of government unfortunately it had been demonstrated at the cost of some hundreds of millions of lives that it was only applicable to social insects robots class ii and similar restricted categories
for imperfect human beings the least worst answer was demosocracy frequently defined as individual greed moderated by an efficient but not too zealous government
soon after the braincap came into general use some highly intelligent and maximally zealous bureaucrats realized that it had a unique potential as an early warning system
during the setting up process when the new wearer was being mentally calibrated it was possible to detect many forms of psychosis before they had a chance of becoming dangerous
often this suggested the best therapy but when no cure appeared possible the subject could be electronically tagged or in extreme cases segregated from society
of course this mental monitoring could test only those who were fitted with a braincap but by the end of the third millennium this was as essential for everyday life as the personal telephone had been at its beginning
in fact anyone who did not join the vast majority was automatically suspect and checked as a potential deviant
needless to say when mind probing as its critics called it started coming into general use there were cries of outrage from civil rights organizations one of their most effective slogans was braincap or braincop slowly even reluctantly it was accepted that this form of monitoring was a necessary precaution against far worse evils and it was no coincidence that with the general improvement in mental health religious fanaticism also started its rapid decline
when the long drawn out war against the cybernet criminals ended the victors found themselves owning an embarrassing collection of spoils all of them utterly incomprehensible to any past conqueror
there were of course hundreds of computer viruses most of them very difficult to detect and kill
and there were some entities for want of a better name that were much more terrifying
they were brilliantly invented diseases for which there was no cure in some cases not even the possibility of a cure
many of them had been linked to great mathematicians who would have been horrified by this corruption of their discoveries
as it is a human characteristic to belittle a real danger by giving it an absurd name the designations were often facetious the godel gremlin the mandelbrot maze the combinatorial catastrophe the transfinite trap the conway conundrum the turing torpedo the lorentz labyrinth the boolean bomb the shannon snare the cantor cataclysm
if any generalization was possible all these mathematical horrors operated on the same principle
they did not depend for their effectiveness on anything as na ve as memory erasure or code corruption on the contrary
their approach was more subtle they persuaded their host machine to initiate a program which could not be completed before the end of the universe or which the mandelbrot maze was the deadliest example involved a literally infinite series of steps
a trivial example would be the calculation of pi or any other irrational number
however even the most stupid electro optic computer would not fall into such a simple trap the day had long since passed when mechanical morons would wear out their gears grinding them to powder as they tried to divide by zero
the challenge to the demon programmers was to convince their targets that the task set them had a definite conclusion that could be reached in a finite time
in the battle of wits between man seldom woman despite such role models as lady ada lovelace admiral grace hopper and dr susan calvin and machine the machine almost invariably lost
it would have been possible though in some cases difficult and even risky to destroy the captured obscenities by erase overwrite commands but they represented an enormous investment in time and ingenuity which however misguided seemed a pity to waste
and more important perhaps they should be kept for study in some secure location as a safeguard against the time when some evil genius might reinvent and deploy them
the solution was obvious
the digital demons should be sealed with their chemical and biological counterparts it was hoped for ever in the pico vault
37
operation damocles poole never had much contact with the team who assembled the weapon everyone hoped would never have to be used
the operation ominously but aptly named damocles was so highly specialized that he could contribute nothing directly and he saw enough of the task force to realize that some of them might almost belong to an alien species
indeed one key member was apparently in a lunatic asylum poole had been surprised to find that such places still existed and chairperson oconnor sometimes suggested that at least two others should join him
have you ever heard of the enigma project she remarked to poole after a particularly frustrating session
when he shook his head she continued i m surprised it was only a few decades before you were born i came across it while when i was researching material for damocles
very similar problem in one of your wars a group of brilliant mathematicians was gathered together in great secrecy to break an enemy code incidentally they built one of the very first real computers to make the job possible and there s a lovely story i hope it s true that reminds me of our own little team
one day the prime minister came on a visit of inspection and afterwards he said to enigma s director when i told you to leave no stone unturned to get the men you needed i didn t expect you to take me so literally presumably all the right stones had been turned for project damocles
however as no one knew whether they were working against a deadline of days weeks or years at first it was hard to generate any sense of urgency
the need for secrecy also created problems since there was no point in spreading alarm throughout the solar system not more than fifty people knew of the project
but they were the people who mattered who could marshal all the forces necessary and who alone could authorize the opening of the pico vault for the first time in five hundred years
when halman reported that the monolith was receiving messages with increasing frequency there seemed little doubt that something was going to happen
poole was not the only one who found it hard to sleep in those days even with the help of the braincap s anti insomnia programs
before he finally did get to sleep he often wondered if he would wake up again
but at last all the components of the weapon were assembled a weapon invisible untouchable and unimaginable to almost all the warriors who had ever lived
nothing could have looked more harmless and innocent than the perfectly standard terabyte memory tablet used with millions of braincaps every day
but the fact that it was encased in a massive block of crystalline material criss crossed with metal bands indicated that it was something quite out of the ordinary
poole received it with reluctance he wondered if the courier who had been given the awesome task of carrying the hiroshima atom bomb s core to the pacific airbase from which it was launched had felt the same way
and yet if all their fears were justified his responsibility might be even greater
and he could not be certain that even the first part of his mission would be successful
because no circuit could be absolutely secure halman had not yet been informed about project damocles poole would do that when he returned to ganymede
then he could only hope that halman would be willing to play the role of trojan horse and perhaps be destroyed in the process
38
pre emptive strike it was strange to be back in the hotel grannymede after all these years strangest of all because it seemed completely unchanged despite everything that had happened
poole was still greeted by the familiar image of bowman as he walked into the suite named after him and as he expected bowman halman was waiting looking slightly less substantial than the ancient hologram
before they could even exchange greetings there was an interruption that poole would have welcomed at any other time than this
the room vidphone gave its urgent trio of rising notes also unchanged since his last visit and an old friend appeared on the screen
frank cried theodore khan why didn t you tell me you were coming
when can we meet
why no video someone with you
and who were all those official looking types who landed at the same time please ted
yes i m sorry but believe me i ve got very good reasons i ll explain later
and i do have someone with me call you back just as soon as i can
goodbye as he belatedly gave the do not disturb order poole said apologetically sorry about that you know who it was of course yes dr khan
he often tried to get in touch with me but you never answered
may i ask why though there were far more important matters to worry about poole could not resist putting the question
ours was the only channel i wished to keep open
also i was often away
sometimes for years that was surprising yet it should not have been
poole knew well enough that halman had been reported in many places in many times
yet away for years
he might have visited quite a few star systems perhaps that was how he knew about nova scorpio only forty light years distant
but he could never have gone all the way to the node there and back would have been a nine hundred year journey
how lucky that you were here when we needed you it was very unusual for halman to hesitate before replying
there was much longer than the unavoidable three second time lag before he said slowly are you sure that it was luck what do you mean i do not wish to talk about it but twice i have glimpsed powers entities far superior to the monoliths and perhaps even their makers
we may both have less freedom than we imagine that was indeed a chilling thought poole needed a deliberate effort of will to put it aside and concentrate on the immediate problem
let us hope we have enough free will to do what is necessary
perhaps this is a foolish question
does the monolith know that we are meeting
could it be suspicious it is not capable of such an emotion
it has numerous fault protection devices some of which i understand
but that is all could it be overhearing us now i do not believe so i wish that i could be sure it was such a na ve and simple minded super genius thought poole as he unlocked his briefcase and took out the sealed box containing the tablet
in this low gravity its weight was almost negligible it was impossible to believe that it might hold the destiny of mankind
there was no way we could be certain of getting a secure circuit to you so we couldn t go into details
this tablet contains programs which we hope will prevent the monolith from carrying out any orders which threaten mankind
there are twenty of the most devastating viruses ever designed on this most of which have no known antidote in some cases it is believed that none is possible
there are five copies of each
we would like you to release them when and if you think it is necessary
dave hal no one has ever been given such a responsibility
but we have no other choice once again the reply seemed to take longer than the three second round trip from europa
if we do this all the monolith s functions may cease
we are uncertain what will happen to us then we have considered that of course
but by this lime you must surely have many facilities at your command some of them probably beyond our understanding
i am also sending you a petabyte memory tablet
ten to the fifteenth bytes is more than sufficient to hold all the memories and experiences of many lifetimes
this will give you one escape route i suspect you have others correct
we will decide which to use at the appropriate time poole relaxed as far as was possible in this extraordinary situation
halman was willing to co operate he still had sufficient links with his origins
now we have to get this tablet to you physically
its contents are too dangerous to risk sending over any radio or optical channel
i know you possess long range control of matter did you not once detonate an orbiting bomb
could you transport it to europa
alternatively we could send it in an auto courier to any point you specify that would be best i will collect it in tsienville
here are the co ordinates poole was still slumped in his chair when the bowman suite monitor admitted the head of the delegation that had accompanied him from earth
whether colonel jones was a genuine colonel or even if his name was jones were minor mysteries which poole was not really interested in solving it was sufficient that he was a superb organizer and had handled the mechanics of operation damocles with quiet efficiency
well frank it s on its way
will be landing in one hour ten minutes
i assume that halman can take it from there but i don t understand how he can actually handle is that the right word
these tablets i wondered about that until someone on the europa committee explained it
there s a well known though not to me
theorem stating that any computer can emulate any other computer
so i m sure that halman knows exactly what he s doing
he would never have agreed otherwise i hope you re right replied the colonel
if not well i don t know what alternative we have there was a gloomy pause until poole did his best to relieve the tension
by the way have you heard the local rumor about our visit which particular one that we re a special commission sent here to investigate crime and corruption in this raw frontier township
the mayor and the sheriff are supposed to be running scared how i envy them said colonel jones
sometimes it s quite a relief to have something trivial to worry about 39
deicide like all the inhabitants of anubis city population now 56 521 dr theodore khan woke soon after local midnight to the sound of the general alarm
his first reaction was not another icequake for deus s sake he rushed to the window shouting open so loudly that the room did not understand and he had to repeat the order in a normal voice
the light of lucifer should have come streaming in painting the patterns on the floor that so fascinated visitors from earth because they never moved even a fraction of a millimeter no matter how long they waited that unvarying beam of light was no longer there
as khan stared in utter disbelief through the huge transparent bubble of the anubis dome he saw a sky that ganymede had not known for a thousand years
it was once more ablaze with stars lucifer had gone
and then as he explored the forgotten constellations kahn noticed something even more terrifying
where lucifer should have been was a tiny disc of absolute blackness eclipsing the unfamiliar stars
there was only one possible explanation khan told himself numbly
lucifer has been swallowed by a black hole
and it may be our turn next
on the balcony of the grannymede hotel poole was watching the same spectacle but with more complex emotions
even before the general alarm his comsec had woken him with a message from halman
it is beginning
we have infected the monolith
but one perhaps several of the viruses have entered our own circuits
we do not know if we will be able to use the memory tablet you have given us
if we succeed we will meet you in tsienville then came the surprising and strangely moving words whose exact emotional content would be debated for generations if we are unable to download remember us from the room behind him poole heard the voice of the mayor doing his best to reassure the now sleepless citizens of anubis
though he opened with that most terrifying of official statements no cause for alarm the mayor did indeed have words of comfort
we don t know what s happening but lucifer s still shining normally
i repeat lucifer is still shining
we ve just received news from the interorbit shuttle alcyone which left for callisto half an hour ago
here s their view poole left the balcony and rushed into his room just in time to see lucifer blaze reassuringly on the vidscreen
what s happened the mayor continued breathlessly is that something has caused a temporary eclipse we ll zoom in to look at it callisto observatory come in please how does he know it s temporary
thought poole as he waited for the next image to come up on the screen
lucifer vanished to be replaced by a field of stars
at the same time the mayor faded out and another voice took over two meter telescope but almost any instrument will do
it s a disc of perfectly black material just over ten thousand kilometers across so thin it shows no visible thickness
and it s placed exactly obviously deliberately to block ganymede from receiving any light
we ll zoom in to see if it shows any details though i rather doubt it from the viewpoint of callisto the occulting disc was foreshortened into an oval twice as long as it was wide
it expanded until it completely filled the screen thereafter it was impossible to tell whether the image was being zoomed as it showed no structure whatsoever
as i thought there s nothing to see
let s pan over to the edge of the thing again there was no sense of motion until a field of stars suddenly appeared sharply defined by the curving edge of the world sized disc
it was exactly as if they were looking past the horizon of an airless perfectly smooth planet
no it was not perfectly smooth that s interesting commented the astronomer who until now had sounded remarkably matter of fact as if this sort of thing was an everyday occurrence
the edge looks jagged but in a very regular fashion like a saw blade a circular saw poole muttered under his breath
is it going to carve us up
don t be ridiculous this is as close as we can get before diffraction spoils the image we ll process it later and get much better detail the magnification was now so great that all trace of the disc s circularity had vanished
across the vidscreen was a black band serrated along its edge with triangles so identical that poole found it hard to avoid the ominous analogy of a saw blade
yet something else was nagging at the back of his mind like everyone else on ganymede he watched the infinitely more distant stars drifting in and out of those geometrically perfect valleys
very probably many others jumped to the same conclusion even before he did
if you attempt to make a disc out of rectangular blocks whether their proportions are 1 4 9 or any other it cannot possibly have a smooth edge
of course you can make it as near a perfect circle as you like by using smaller and smaller blocks
yet why go to that trouble if you merely wanted to build a screen large enough to eclipse a sun
the mayor was right the eclipse was indeed temporary
but its ending was the precise opposite of a solar one
first light broke through at the exact center not in the usual necklace of bailey s beads along the very edge
jagged lines radiated from a dazzling pinhole and now under the highest magnification the structure of the disc was being revealed
it was composed of millions of identical rectangles perhaps the same size as the great wall of europa
and now they were splitting apart it was as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle was being dismantled
its perpetual but now briefly interrupted daylight was slowly returning to ganymede as the disc fragmented and the rays of lucifer poured through the widening gaps
now the components themselves were evaporating almost as if they needed the reinforcement of each other s contact to maintain reality
although it seemed like hours to the anxious watchers in anubis city the whole event lasted for less than fifteen minutes
not until it was all over did anyone pay attention to europa itself
the great wall was gone and it was almost an hour before the news came from earth mars and moon that the sun itself had appeared to flicker for a few seconds before resuming business as usual
it had been a highly selective set of eclipses obviously targeted at humankind
nowhere else in the solar system would anything have been noticed
in the general excitement it was a little longer before the world realized that tma zero and tma one had both vanished leaving only their four million year old imprints on tycho and africa
it was the first time the europs could ever have met humans but they seemed neither alarmed nor surprised by the huge creatures moving among them at such lightning speed
of course it was not too easy to interpret the emotional state of something that looked like a small leafless bush with no obvious sense organs or means of communication
but if they were frightened by the arrival of alcyone and the emergence of its passengers they would surely have remained hiding in their igloos
as frank poole slightly encumbered by his protective suit and the gift of shining copper wire he was carrying walked into the untidy suburbs of tsienville he wondered what the europs thought of recent events
for them there had been no eclipse of lucifer but the disappearance of the great wall must surely have been a shock
it had stood there for a thousand years as a shield and doubtless much more then abruptly it was gone as if it had never been
the petabyte tablet was waiting for him with a group of europs standing around it demonstrating the first sign of curiosity that poole had ever observed in them
he wondered if halman had somehow told them to watch over this gift from space until he came to collect it
and to take it back since it now contained not only a sleeping friend but terrors which some future age might exorcise to the only place where it could be safely stored

midnight pico it would be hard poole thought to imagine a more peaceful scene especially after the trauma of the last weeks
the slanting rays of a nearly full earth revealed all the subtle details of the waterless sea of rains not obliterating them as the incandescent fury of the sun would do
the small convoy of mooncars was arranged in a semicircle a hundred meters from the inconspicuous opening at the base of pico that was the entrance to the vault
from this viewpoint poole could see that the mountain did not live up to the name that the early astronomers misled by its pointed shadow had given to it
it was more like a rounded hill than a sharp peak and he could well believe that one of the local pastimes was bicycle riding to the summit
until now none of those sportsmen and women could have guessed at the secret hidden beneath their wheels he hoped that the sinister knowledge would not discourage their healthy exercise
an hour ago with a sense of mingled sadness and triumph he had handed over the tablet he had brought never letting it out of his sight from ganymede directly to the moon
goodbye old friends he had murmured
you ve done well
perhaps some future generation will reawaken you
but on the whole i rather hope not he could imagine all too clearly one desperate reason why halman s knowledge might be needed again
by now surely some message was on its way to that unknown control center bearing the news that its servant on europa no longer existed
with reasonable luck it would take 95 years give or take a few before any response could be expected
poole had often cursed einstein in the past now he blessed him
even the powers behind the monoliths it now appeared certain could not spread their influence faster than the speed of light
so the human race should have almost a millennium to prepare for the next encounter if there was to be one
perhaps by that time it would be better prepared
something was emerging from the tunnel the track mounted semi humanoid robot that had carried the tablet into the vault
it was almost comic to see a machine enclosed in the kind of isolation suit used as protection against deadly germs and here on the airless moon
but no one was taking any chances however unlikely they might seem
after all the robot had moved among those carefully sequestered nightmares and although according to its video cameras everything appeared in order there was always a chance that some vial had leaked or some canister s seal had broken
the moon was a very stable environment but during the centuries it had known many quakes and meteor impacts
the robot came to a halt fifty meters outside the tunnel
slowly the massive plug that sealed the vault swung back into place and began to rotate in its threads like a giant bolt being screwed into the mountain
all not wearing dark glasses please close your eyes or look away from the robot said an urgent voice over the mooncar radio
poole twisted round in his seat just in time to see an explosion of light on the roof of the vehicle
when he turned back to look at pico all that was left of the robot was a heap of glowing slag even to someone who had spent much of his life surrounded by vacuum it seemed altogether wrong that tendrils of smoke were not slowly spiralling up from it
sterilization completed said the voice of the mission controller
thank you everybody
now returning to plato city how ironic that the human race had been saved by the skilful deployment of its own insanities
what moral poole wondered could one possibly draw from that
he looked back at the beautiful blue earth huddling beneath its tattered blanket of clouds for protection against the cold of space
up there a few weeks from now he hoped to cradle his first grandson in his arms
whatever godlike powers and principalities lurked beyond the stars poole reminded himself for ordinary humans only two things were important love and death
his body had not yet aged a hundred years he still had plenty of time for both
